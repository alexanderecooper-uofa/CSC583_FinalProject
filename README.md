# CSC583 FinalProject

## Code Overview 
The project contains three notebooks. 

- setup.ipynb sets up the environment and prepares the data. The first few cells in this notebook install packages needed by the rest of the project, you should run those cells. The rest of the cells create data files and do not need to be run since the data was shared with you.
- watson_attempt1.ipynb is the first attempt at implementing Watson.
- watson_attempt2.ipynb is the second attempt at implementing Watson, after the error analysis.

There are also two python files in the project, env.py and shared.py.
- env.py defines some environment specific globals, such as the data directory path.
- shared.py} is shared code between the two Watson attempts. It exists mostly to declutter the notebooks from having a bunch of duplicate code. It loads data and defines some functions used by both attempts.
