I am about to give you a sequence of terms.
I want you to rank the terms in the query by frequency in the English language, and return the 3 terms with the lowest frequency in JSON format, like this:
{
    "term1": "<term_with_lowest_frequency>",
    "term2": "<term_with_second_lowest_frequency>",
    "term3": "<term_with_third_lowest_frequency>",
}

The following sentence is the sequence of terms.
