Boot Hill, or Boothill, is the name for any number of cemeteries, chiefly in the American West. During the 19th century it was a common name for the burial grounds of gunfighters, or those who "died with their boots on" (i.e., violently).

==Origin of term==

Although many towns use the name "Boot Hill", the first graveyard named "Boot Hill" was at Dodge City, Kansas.[tpl]cite news| title=Will Movies Recapture Spirit of Fabulous Old Dodge City's Life of Sin?| url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&dat=19390110&id=Z6pQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=GiIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4997,2094546| accessdate=11/3/2011| newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal| date=January 10, 1939[/tpl] The term alludes to the fact that many of its occupants were cowboys who "died with their boots on," the implication here being they died violently, as in gunfights or by hanging, and not of natural causes.  The term became commonplace throughout the Old West, with some Boot Hills becoming famous, such as Dodge City, Kansas, Tombstone, Arizona, and Deadwood, South Dakota.

==Boothill Graveyard==

The most notable use of the name "Boot Hill" is at the Boothill Graveyard in Tombstone, Arizona. [tpl]coord|31|43|11.6|N|110|04|13.6|W|type:landmark_region:US-AZ|display=inline |name=Boothill Graveyard[/tpl] Formerly called the "Tombstone Cemetery", the plot features the graves of Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury and Tom McLaury; the three men who were killed during the famed Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.Martin, Douglas D. (1997). Tombstone's Epitaph. University of Oklahoma Press. ISBN 978-0-8061-2982-2.
Located on the northwest corner of the town, the graveyard is believed to hold over 300 persons, 205 of which are recorded. This was due to some people (especially Chinese and Jewish immigrants) being buried without record. There is a separate Jewish cemetery nearby with some markers restored, and there are also marked graves of Chinese. However, most of the loss was due to neglect of grave markers and theft of these wooden relics as souvenirs.Interment Cemetery Records. Retrieved 2010-03-11. For example, when former Tombstone Mayor John Clum visited Tombstone for the first Helldorado celebration in 1929, he was unable to locate the grave of his wife Mary, who had been buried in Boothill.
The Tombstone "boothill" cemetery was closed in late 1886, as the new "City Cemetery" on Allen Street opened. Thereafter, Boothill was referred to as the "old city cemetery" and neglected. It was used after that only to bury a few later outlaws (some legally hanged and one shot in a robbery), as well as a few colorful Western characters and one man (Emmett Crook Nunnally) who had spent many volunteer hours restoring it.Ben T. Traywick, Tombstone's Boothill, Red Marie's Bookstore, Tombstone AZ, 1971.
Currently, the Boothill Graveyard is open to the public without fee, and is a popular stop for tourists visiting Tombstone.

Boot Hill is the name of the cemetery in Dodge City in the Gunsmoke radio series. In many episodes, the marshal (Matt Dillon) would allude to "putting you in Boot Hill", or "another man headed to Boot Hill". In the first season of the Gunsmoke television series, the introduction to each episode showed Matt Dillon walking around Boot Hill reflecting on the deaths of men buried there.
Boothill Graveyard is referenced in many films such as Tombstone (1993), Wyatt Earp (1994), and Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957), during which it was repeatedly sung over the recurring title theme song by Frankie Laine. In the later half of the movie Laine changes the theme to:

Boot Hill is the name of a role playing game first published in 1975 by TSR, Inc., the original publisher of Dungeons and Dragons. It was the third game released by TSR and notable as one of the first games to use ten-sided dice.
Boot hill also appears in the popular first person shooter Borderlands 2, located in 'The Dust', and playing home to a 'truxican standoff'.
Carl Perkins wrote in 1959 a song The Ballad of Boot Hill. Johnny Cash recorded it for Columbia Records and it was released in the same year.
In 1969,  an Italian Spaghetti Western named Boot Hill was made. It featured Terence Hill and Bud Spencer.
