Raised on the South Side of Chicago, Obama attended Princeton University and Harvard Law School before returning to Chicago to work at the law firm Sidley Austin, where she met her future husband. Subsequently, she worked as part of the staff of Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley, and for the University of Chicago Medical Center.
Throughout 2007 and 2008, she helped campaign for her husband's presidential bid. She delivered a keynote address at the 2008 Democratic National Convention and also spoke at the 2012 Democratic National Convention. She is the mother of daughters Malia and Natasha (Sasha).

The change was even reflected in her fashion choices, wearing more informal clothes in place of her previous designer pieces.  The View appearance was partly intended to help soften her public image, and it was widely covered in the press.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/19/us/politics/19watch.html? | title=Michelle Obama Shows Her Warmer Side on 'The View' | accessdate=October 13, 2008 | date=June 19, 2008 |work=The New York Times | author=Stanley, Alessandra[/tpl]

Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama (born January 17, 1964), an American lawyer and writer, is the wife of the 44th and current President of the United States, Barack Obama, and the first African-American First Lady of the United States. Raised on the South Side of Chicago, Obama attended Princeton University and Harvard Law School before returning to Chicago to work at the law firm Sidley Austin, where she met her future husband. Subsequently, she worked as part of the staff of Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley, and for the University of Chicago Medical Center.
Throughout 2007 and 2008, she helped campaign for her husband's presidential bid. She delivered a keynote address at the 2008 Democratic National Convention and also spoke at the 2012 Democratic National Convention. She is the mother of daughters Malia and Natasha (Sasha).

===Religion===

Michelle Obama is a Protestant Christian. She was raised Methodist and joined the Trinity United Church of Christ, where she and Barack Obama married, performed by Rev. Jeremiah Wright. On May 31, 2008, Barack and Michelle Obama announced that they had withdrawn their membership in Trinity United Church of Christ stating that "Our relations with Trinity have been strained by the divisive statements of Reverend Wright, which sharply conflict with our own views".[tpl]cite news|url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/sweet/2008/05/obama_resigns_from_trinity_uni.html|title=Obama resigns from Trinity United Church of Christ.

The Obama family has attended several different churches since moving to Washington D.C. in 2009, including Shiloh Baptist Church and St. John's Episcopal Church. At the 49th African Methodist Episcopal Church's general conference, Michelle Obama encouraged the attendees to advocate for political awareness, saying "To anyone who says that church is no place to talk about these issues, you tell them there is no place better – no place better, because ultimately, these are not just political issues – they are moral issues, they're issues that have to do with human dignity and human potential, and the future we want for our kids and our grandkids."[tpl]cite press release|last=Obama|first=Michelle|title=Remarks by the First Lady at the African Methodist Episcopal Church Conference|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/06/28/remarks-first-lady-african-methodist-episcopal-church-conference|publisher=The White House|accessdate=February 22, 2013[/tpl]

==Career==

Following law school, she was an associate at the Chicago office of the law firm Sidley Austin, where she first met her future husband. At the firm, she worked on marketing and intellectual property.  She continues to hold her law license, but as she no longer needs it for her work, it has been on a voluntary inactive status since 1993.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/lawlicenses.asp|title=Taking License|date=April 8, 2010|publisher=Snopes[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=The Obamas' Law Licenses|url=http://factcheck.org/2012/06/the-obamas-law-licenses/|date=June 14, 2012|first=D'Angelo|last=Gore|publisher=FactCheck|accessdate=June 22, 2012[/tpl]
In 1991, she held public sector positions in the Chicago city government as an Assistant to the Mayor, and as Assistant Commissioner of Planning and Development. In 1993, she became Executive Director for the Chicago office of Public Allies, a non-profit organization encouraging young people to work on social issues in nonprofit groups and government agencies.  She worked there nearly four years and set fundraising records for the organization that still stood 12 years after she left.
In 1996, she served as the Associate Dean of Student Services at the University of Chicago, where she developed the University's Community Service Center.  In 2002, she began working for the University of Chicago Hospitals, first as executive director for community affairs and, beginning May 2005, as Vice President for Community and External Affairs.[tpl]cite press release|url=http://www.uchospitals.edu/news/2005/20050509-obama.html|publisher=University of Chicago Medical Center|title=Michelle Obama appointed vice president for community and external affairs at the University of Chicago Hospitals|date=May 9, 2005|accessdate=April 4, 2009[/tpl] She continued to hold the University of Chicago Hospitals position during the primary campaign, but cut back to part-time in order to spend time with her daughters as well as work for her husband's election;[tpl]cite news | url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Vote2008/story?id=4179656&page=1 |work=ABC News |title=Michelle Obama: Mom First, Politics Second |author=Snow, Kate|date=January 24, 2008|accessdate=April 4, 2009[/tpl] she subsequently took a leave of absence from her job.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-michelle_obama_first_ladynov09,0,7595775.story | title=Michelle Obama blazes a new trail | author= St. Clair, Stacy |work=Chicago Tribune | date=November 8, 2008 | accessdate=November 20, 2008[/tpl] According to the couple's 2006 income tax return, her salary was $273,618 from the University of Chicago Hospitals, while her husband had a salary of $157,082 from the United States Senate.

==Support of Barack Obama US House and Senate campaigns==

Although Obama has campaigned on her husband's behalf since early in his political career by handshaking and fund-raising, she did not relish the activity at first. When she campaigned during her husband's 2000 run for United States House of Representatives, her boss at the University of Chicago asked if there was any single thing about campaigning that she enjoyed; after some thought, she replied that visiting so many living rooms had given her some new decorating ideas.[tpl]cite news | author=Kantor, Jodi | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/26/us/politics/26michelle.html?scp=2&sq=Michelle%20Obama&st=cse |title=Michelle Obama, reluctant no more |work=The New York Times |date=August 25, 2008 |accessdate=August 27, 2008[/tpl]

The change was even reflected in her fashion choices, wearing more informal clothes in place of her previous designer pieces.

===LGBT rights===

Michelle Obama has been an advocate of LGBT rights. In the 2008 US presidential election, Michelle boasted, to gay Democrat groups, of her husband's record on LGBT rights, including his cosponsoring of a bill amending the Illinois Human Rights Act to include protections for LGBT people which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in the workplace, housing, and all public places, his support for the Illinois gender violence act, his support for the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, his support for hate crimes protection for sexual orientation and gender identity, his support for renewed effort to fight HIV and AIDS, his support for repealing Don't Ask Don't Tell, his support for a full repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act, his support for civil unions, and his opposition to constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage in the federal, California, and Florida constitutions. She said that the US Supreme Court delivered justice in the Lawrence v. Texas case and drew a connection between the struggles for gay rights and civil rights by stating "We are all only here because of those who marched and bled and died, from Selma to Stonewall, in the pursuit of a more perfect union."[tpl]cite news|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/talesfromthetrail/2008/06/26/michelle-obama-speaks-to-gay-democrats/|title=Michelle Obama speaks to gay Democrats|accessdate=January 22, 2013|date=June 27, 2008|work=Reuters[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/talk/2008/06/the-audacity-of-hope-from-selm.php|title=The audacity of hope – 'from Selma to Stonewall[tpl]'-[/tpl]|accessdate=January 22, 2013|date=June 27, 2008|work=TMP[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.towleroad.com/2008/08/michelle-obama.html|title=Michelle Obama Speaks to LGBT Delegates at Convention Lunch|accessdate=January 22, 2013|date=August 27, 2008|work=Towleroad[/tpl]
