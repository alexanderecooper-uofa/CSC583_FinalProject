The Wall Street Journal is an American English-language international daily newspaper with a special emphasis on business and economic news. It is published six days a week in New York City by Dow Jones & Company, a division of News Corp, along with the Asian and European editions of the Journal.
The Journal is the largest newspaper in the United States, by circulation. According to the Alliance for Audited Media, it has a circulation of about 2.4 million copies (including nearly 900,000 digital subscriptions), as of March 2013,[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/business/media/27audit.html|work=The New York Times|title=Newspaper Circulation Falls Nearly 9%|first=Joseph|last=Plambeck|date=April 26, 2010[/tpl] compared with USA Today[tpl]'s[/tpl] 1.7 million. Its main rival in the business newspaper sector is the London-based Financial Times, which also publishes several international editions.
The Journal primarily covers American economic and international business topics, and financial news and issues. Its name derives from Wall Street, located in New York City, which is the heart of the financial district; it has been printed continuously since its inception on July 8, 1889, by Charles Dow, Edward Jones, and Charles Bergstresser.

==History==

===Beginnings===

Dow Jones & Company's, publisher of the Journal, first product was brief news bulletins hand-delivered throughout the day to traders at the stock exchange.  They were later aggregated in a printed daily summary called the Customers' Afternoon Letter. The reporters Charles Dow, Edward Jones and Charles Bergstresser converted this into The Wall Street Journal, which was published for the first time on July 8, 1889.Dow Jones & Co. Inc. "Dow Jones History – The Late 1800s". Retrieved July 25, 2013. and began delivery of the Dow Jones News Service via telegraph. In 1896, The "Dow Jones Industrial Average" was officially launched.  It was the first of several indices of stock and bond prices on the New York Stock Exchange.  In 1899 "The Journal's" 'Review & Outlook column, which still runs today, appears for the first time.  It initially was written by Charles Dow.
Journalist Clarence Barron purchased control of the company for US$130,000 in 1902; circulation was then around 7,000 but climbed to 50,000 by the end of the 1920s. Barron and his predecessors were credited with creating an atmosphere of fearless, independent financial reporting—a novelty in the early days of business journalism.  In 1921, Barron's, America's premier financial weekly, was founded.Crossen, Cynthia. "It All Began in the Basement of a Candy Store". The Wall Street Journal (New York), p. B1, August 1, 2007.
Barron died in 1928, a year before Black Tuesday, the stock market crash that greatly affected the Great Depression in the United States. Barron's descendants, the Bancroft family, would continue to control the company until 2007.
The Journal took its modern shape and prominence in the 1940s, a time of industrial expansion for the United States and its financial institutions in New York. Bernard Kilgore was named managing editor of the paper in 1941, and company CEO in 1945, eventually compiling a 25-year career as the head of the Journal. Kilgore was the architect of the paper's iconic front-page design, with its "What's News" digest, and its national distribution strategy, which brought the paper's circulation from 33,000 in 1941 to 1.1 million at the time of Kilgore's death in 1967. It was also on Kilgore's watch, in 1947, that the paper won its first Pulitzer Prize, for editorials by William Henry Grimes.
In 1967 Dow Jones Newswires began a major expansion outside of the U.S. that ultimately put journalists in every major financial center in Europe, Asia, Latin America, Australia, and Africa.
In 1970 Dow Jones bought the Ottaway newspaper chain, which at the time comprised nine dailies and three Sunday newspapers.  Later, the name was changed to "Dow Jones Local Media Group."
1971 to 1997 brought about a series of launches, acquisitions, and joint ventures, including, "Factiva," "The Asian Wall Street Journal," "The Wall Street Journal Europe," "WSJ.com," "Dow Jones Indexes," "MarketWatch," and "WSJ Weekend Edition."
In 2007 News Corp., the world's most global media company[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]
, acquired Dow Jones.
WSJ. Magazine, a glossy luxury lifestyle publication, was launched in 2008.

===Internet expansion===

A complement to the print newspaper, The Wall Street Journal Online, was launched in 1996. In 2003, Dow Jones began to integrate reporting of the Journal's print and online subscribers together in Audit Bureau of Circulations statements."The Wall Street Journal Announces New Integrated Print and Online Sales and Marketing Initiatives". Press release. November 3, 2003. In 2007, it was commonly believed to be the largest paid-subscription news site on the Web, with 980,000 paid subscribers. Since then, online subscribership has fallen, due in part to rising subscription costs, and was reported at 400,000 in March 2010. In May 2008, an annual subscription to the online edition of The Wall Street Journal cost $119 for those who do not have subscriptions to the print edition. By June 2013, the monthly cost for a subscription to the online edition was $22.99, or $275.88 annually, excluding introductory offers.[tpl]cite web|url=https://subscribe.wsj.com |title=Subscribing to the Wall Street Journal|work=WSJ|date=June 17, 2013 [/tpl]

In September 2005, the Journal launched a weekend edition, delivered to all subscribers, which marked a return to Saturday publication after a lapse of some 50 years. The move was designed in part to attract more consumer advertising.
In 2005, the Journal reported a readership profile of about 60 percent top management, an average income of $191,000, an average household net worth of $2.1 million, and an average age of 55.Mitchell, Bill.

In 2006, the Journal began including advertising on its front page for the first time.

===News Corporation and News Corp===

On May 2, 2007, News Corporation made an unsolicited takeover bid for Dow Jones, offering US$60 a share for stock that had been selling for US$33 a share. The Bancroft family, which controlled more than 60% of the voting stock, at first rejected the offer, but later reconsidered its position.For background and sequel, see: Ellison, Sarah, War at the Wall Street Journal: Inside the Struggle To Control an American Business Empire, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2010.

A special committee was established to oversee the Journal[tpl]'[/tpl]s editorial integrity. When the managing editor Marcus Brauchli resigned on April 22, 2008, the committee said that News Corporation had violated its agreement by not notifying the committee earlier.

A 2007 Journal article quoted charges that Murdoch had made and broken similar promises in the past. One large shareholder commented that Murdoch has long "expressed his personal, political and business biases through his newspapers and television stations." Former Times assistant editor Fred Emery remembers an incident when "Mr. Murdoch called him into his office in March 1982 and said he was considering firing Times editor Harold Evans. Mr. Emery says he reminded Mr. Murdoch of his promise that editors couldn't be fired without the independent directors' approval. 'God, you don't take all that seriously, do you?' Mr. Murdoch answered, according to Mr. Emery." Murdoch eventually forced out Evans.WSJ, Calling the shots: In Murdoch's career, a hand in the news; his aggressive style can blur boundaries; 'Buck stops with me', by Steve Stecklow, Aaron O.

In 2011, The Guardian found evidence that the Journal had artificially inflated its European sales numbers, by paying Executive Learning Partnership for purchasing 16% of European sales. These inflated sales numbers then enabled the Journal to charge similarly inflated advertising rates, as the advertisers would think that they reached more readers than they actually did. In addition, the Journal agreed to run "articles" featuring Executive Learning Partnership, presented as news, but effectively advertising.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/oct/12/wall-street-journal-andrew-langhoff|title=Wall Street Journal circulation scam claims senior Murdoch executive|date=October 12, 2011|accessdate=2011-10-13|location=London|work=The Guardian|first=Nick|last=Davies[/tpl] The case came to light after a Belgian Wall Street Journal employee, Gert Van Mol, informed Dow Jones CEO Les Hinton, about the questionable practice.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/news-corp-wall-street-journal-phone-hacking-250764|title= News Corp Ignored Wall Street Journal Circulation Inflation (Report)|date=October 12, 2011|accessdate=2011-10-13|location=US|work=The Hollywood Reporter|first= THR |last=Staff[/tpl] As a result the then European Wall Street Journal CEO and Publisher Andrew Langhoff was fired after it was found out he personally pressured journalists into covering one of the newspaper’s business partners involved in the issue.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/149205/wall-street-journal-europe-publisher-resigns-after-deal-suggested-outside-influence-over-editorial-content/|title= WSJ Europe publisher resigns after reports he ‘personally pressured’ journalists into covering paper’s business partner|date=October 13, 2011|accessdate=2011-10-13|location=US|work=Pointer.|first=Steve|last=Meyers[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203499704576625162816696954.html|title= Publisher of WSJ Europe Resigns After Ethics Inquiry|date=October 12, 2011|accessdate=2011-10-13|location=London|work=WSJ Online|first=Paul|last=Sonne[/tpl] Since September 2011 all the online articles that resulted from the ethical wrongdoing carry a Wall Street Journal disclaimer informing the readers about the circumstances in which they were created.

The Journal describes the history of its editorials:
[tpl]quote|They are united by the mantra "free markets and free people", the principles, if you will, marked in the watershed year of 1776 by Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence and Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations. So over the past century and into the next, the Journal stands for free trade and sound money; against confiscatory taxation and the ukases of kings and other collectivists; and for individual autonomy against dictators, bullies and even the tempers of momentary majorities. If these principles sound unexceptionable in theory, applying them to current issues is often unfashionable and controversial.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl][/tpl]
Its historical position was much the same. As former editor William H. Grimes wrote in 1951:
[tpl]quote|On our editorial page we make no pretense of walking down the middle of the road. Our comments and interpretations are made from a definite point of view. We believe in the individual, in his wisdom and his decency. We oppose all infringements on individual rights, whether they stem from attempts at private monopoly, labor union monopoly or from an overgrowing government. People will say we are conservative or even reactionary. We are not much interested in labels but if we were to choose one, we would say we are radical. Just as radical as the Christian doctrine.[tpl]cite news|last=Grimes|first=William H.|title=A Newspaper's Philosophy|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=Jan 2, 1951|location=New York, NY[/tpl] seen in [tpl]cite web|title=A Newspaper's Philosophy |url=http://www.dowjones.com/Products_Services/PrintPublishing/Grimes.htm |work=Dow Jones|publisher=Dow Jones & Company |accessdate=Aug 26, 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070716005137/http://www.dowjones.com/Products_Services/PrintPublishing/Grimes.htm |archivedate=Jul 16, 2007|year=2007[/tpl][/tpl]
Every Thanksgiving the editorial page prints two famous articles that have appeared there since 1961. The first is titled The Desolate Wilderness, and describes what the Pilgrims saw when they arrived at the Plymouth Colony. The second is titled And the Fair Land, and describes the bounty of America. It was written by a former editor, Vermont C. Royster, whose Christmas article In Hoc Anno Domini, has appeared every December 25 since 1949.

===Economic views===

During the Reagan administration, the newspaper's editorial page was particularly influential as the leading voice for supply-side economics. Under the editorship of Robert Bartley, it expounded at length on economic concepts such as the Laffer curve, and how a decrease in certain marginal tax rates and the capital gains tax could allegedly increase overall tax revenue by generating more economic activity.
In the economic argument of exchange rate regimes (one of the most divisive issues among economists), the Journal has a tendency to support fixed exchange rates over floating exchange rates. For example, the Journal was a major supporter of the Chinese yuan's peg to the dollar, and strongly disagreed with American politicians who criticized the Chinese government about the peg. It opposed China's move to let the yuan gradually float, arguing that the fixed rate benefited both the United States and China.
The Journal's views compare with those of the British publication The Economist, with its emphasis on free markets [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl]. However, the Journal demonstrates important distinctions from European business newspapers, most particularly in regard to the relative significance of, and causes of, the American budget deficit. (The Journal generally points to the lack of foreign growth, while business journals in Europe and Asia blame the low savings rate and concordant high borrowing rate in the United States).

===Political views===

The editorial board has long argued for a pro-business immigration policy. In a July 3, 1984 editorial, the board wrote: If Washington still wants to 'do something' about immigration, we propose a five-word constitutional amendment: There shall be open borders.' This stand on immigration reform places the Journal as an opponent of most conservative activists and politicians, for example National Review, who favor heightened restrictions on immigration.[tpl]cite news|last=Rutenberg |first=Jim |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/03/washington/03immig.html?_r=1&hp=&adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1180807796-2rtP/ypH5CxbIhLG9/DQjg&oref=slogin |title=The editorial page commonly publishes pieces by U.S. and world leaders in academia, business, government and politics |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=June 3, 2007 |accessdate=2011-06-05[/tpl]

==Reporting bias==

The Journal's editors stress the independence and impartiality of their reporters. In a 2004 study, Tim Groseclose and Jeff Milyo calculated the ideological bias of 20 media outlets by counting the frequency they cited particular think tanks and comparing that to the frequency that legislators cited the same think tanks. They found that the news reporting of The Journal was the most liberal, more liberal than NPR or The New York Times. The study did not factor in editorials.[tpl]cite doi|10.1162/003355305775097542[/tpl] Mark Liberman criticized the model used to calculate bias in the study and argued that the model unequally affected liberals and conservatives and that "think tank ideology...only matters to liberals."[tpl]cite web| last = Liberman| first = Mark| title = Linguistics, Politics, Mathematics| publisher=Language Log| date = Dec 22, 2005| url = http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002723.html| accessdate = Nov 6, 2006[/tpl]
The company's planned and eventual acquisition by News Corp. in 2007 led to significant media criticism and discussion about whether the news pages would exhibit a rightward slant under Rupert Murdoch. An August 1 editorial responded to the questions by asserting that Murdoch intended to "maintain the values and integrity of the Journal."

==Notable stories and Pulitzer Prizes==

The Journal has won more than 30 Pulitzer Prizes in its history. Staff journalists who led some of the newspaper's best-known coverage teams have later published books that summarized and extended their reporting.

In 1987, a bidding war ensued between several financial firms for tobacco and food giant RJR Nabisco. Bryan Burrough and John Helyar documented the events in more than two dozen Journal articles. Burrough and Helyar later used these articles as the basis of a bestselling book, Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco, which was turned into a film for HBO.[tpl]IMDb title|id=0106356|title=Barbarians at the Gate[/tpl]

"The Eye of the Storm: One Journey Through Desperation and Chaos". The Wall Street Journal, page A1, September 12, 2001. Retrieved August 8, 2007. Top editors worried that they might miss publishing the first issue for the first time in the paper's 112-year history. They relocated to a makeshift office at an editor's home, while sending most of the staff to Dow Jones's South Brunswick, N.J., corporate campus, where the paper had established emergency editorial facilities soon after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The paper was on the stands the next day, albeit in scaled-down form. Perhaps the most compelling story in that day's edition was a first-hand account of the Twin Towers' collapse written by then-Foreign Editor (and current Washington bureau chief) John Bussey, who holed up in a ninth-floor Journal office, literally in the shadow of the towers, from where he phoned in live reports to CNBC as the towers burned. He narrowly escaped serious injury when the first tower collapsed, shattering all the windows in the Journal's offices and filling them with dust and debris. The Journal won a 2002 Pulitzer Prize in Breaking News Reporting for that day's stories.Pulitzer Prize Winners: 2002 – Breaking News, retrieved August 8, 2007.

The Wall Street Journal is an American English-language international daily newspaper with a special emphasis on business and economic news. It is published six days a week in New York City by Dow Jones & Company, a division of News Corp, along with the Asian and European editions of the Journal.
The Journal is the largest newspaper in the United States, by circulation. According to the Alliance for Audited Media, it has a circulation of about 2.4 million copies (including nearly 900,000 digital subscriptions), as of March 2013,[tpl]Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/business/media/27audit.html|work=The New York Times|title=Newspaper Circulation Falls Nearly 9%|first=Joseph|last=Plambeck|date=April 26, 2010[/tpl] compared with USA Today[tpl]'s[/tpl] 1.7 million. Its main rival in the business newspaper sector is the London-based Financial Times, which also publishes several international editions.
The Journal primarily covers American economic and international business topics, and financial news and issues. Its name derives from Wall Street, located in New York City, which is the heart of the financial district; it has been printed continuously since its inception on July 8, 1889, by Charles Dow, Edward Jones, and Charles Bergstresser.

==History==

===Beginnings===

Dow Jones & Company's, publisher of the Journal, first product was brief news bulletins hand-delivered throughout the day to traders at the stock exchange.  They were later aggregated in a printed daily summary called the Customers' Afternoon Letter. The reporters Charles Dow, Edward Jones and Charles Bergstresser converted this into The Wall Street Journal, which was published for the first time on July 8, 1889.Dow Jones & Co. Inc. "Dow Jones History – The Late 1800s". Retrieved July 25, 2013. and began delivery of the Dow Jones News Service via telegraph. In 1896, The "Dow Jones Industrial Average" was officially launched.  It was the first of several indices of stock and bond prices on the New York Stock Exchange.  In 1899 "The Journal's" 'Review & Outlook column, which still runs today, appears for the first time.  It initially was written by Charles Dow.
Journalist Clarence Barron purchased control of the company for US$130,000 in 1902; circulation was then around 7,000 but climbed to 50,000 by the end of the 1920s. Barron and his predecessors were credited with creating an atmosphere of fearless, independent financial reporting—a novelty in the early days of business journalism.  In 1921, Barron's, America's premier financial weekly, was founded.Crossen, Cynthia. "It All Began in the Basement of a Candy Store". The Wall Street Journal (New York), p. B1, August 1, 2007.
Barron died in 1928, a year before Black Tuesday, the stock market crash that greatly affected the Great Depression in the United States. Barron's descendants, the Bancroft family, would continue to control the company until 2007.
The Journal took its modern shape and prominence in the 1940s, a time of industrial expansion for the United States and its financial institutions in New York. Bernard Kilgore was named managing editor of the paper in 1941, and company CEO in 1945, eventually compiling a 25-year career as the head of the Journal. Kilgore was the architect of the paper's iconic front-page design, with its "What's News" digest, and its national distribution strategy, which brought the paper's circulation from 33,000 in 1941 to 1.1 million at the time of Kilgore's death in 1967. It was also on Kilgore's watch, in 1947, that the paper won its first Pulitzer Prize, for editorials by William Henry Grimes.
In 1967 Dow Jones Newswires began a major expansion outside of the U.S. that ultimately put journalists in every major financial center in Europe, Asia, Latin America, Australia, and Africa.
In 1970 Dow Jones bought the Ottaway newspaper chain, which at the time comprised nine dailies and three Sunday newspapers.  Later, the name was changed to "Dow Jones Local Media Group."
1971 to 1997 brought about a series of launches, acquisitions, and joint ventures, including, "Factiva," "The Asian Wall Street Journal," "The Wall Street Journal Europe," "WSJ.com," "Dow Jones Indexes," "MarketWatch," and "WSJ Weekend Edition."
In 2007 News Corp., the world's most global media company[tpl]Citation needed|date=February 2014[/tpl]
, acquired Dow Jones.
WSJ. Magazine, a glossy luxury lifestyle publication, was launched in 2008.

===Internet expansion===

A complement to the print newspaper, The Wall Street Journal Online, was launched in 1996. In 2003, Dow Jones began to integrate reporting of the Journal's print and online subscribers together in Audit Bureau of Circulations statements."The Wall Street Journal Announces New Integrated Print and Online Sales and Marketing Initiatives". Press release. November 3, 2003. In 2007, it was commonly believed to be the largest paid-subscription news site on the Web, with 980,000 paid subscribers. Since then, online subscribership has fallen, due in part to rising subscription costs, and was reported at 400,000 in March 2010. In May 2008, an annual subscription to the online edition of The Wall Street Journal cost $119 for those who do not have subscriptions to the print edition. By June 2013, the monthly cost for a subscription to the online edition was $22.99, or $275.88 annually, excluding introductory offers.[tpl]cite web|url=https://subscribe.wsj.com |title=Subscribing to the Wall Street Journal|work=WSJ|date=June 17, 2013 [/tpl]

Pulitzer-prize winning stories from 1995 are available free on the Pulitzer web site.
In September 2005, the Journal launched a weekend edition, delivered to all subscribers, which marked a return to Saturday publication after a lapse of some 50 years. The move was designed in part to attract more consumer advertising.
In 2005, the Journal reported a readership profile of about 60 percent top management, an average income of $191,000, an average household net worth of $2.1 million, and an average age of 55.Mitchell, Bill.

A 2007 Journal article quoted charges that Murdoch had made and broken similar promises in the past. One large shareholder commented that Murdoch has long "expressed his personal, political and business biases through his newspapers and television stations." Former Times assistant editor Fred Emery remembers an incident when "Mr. Murdoch called him into his office in March 1982 and said he was considering firing Times editor Harold Evans. Mr. Emery says he reminded Mr. Murdoch of his promise that editors couldn't be fired without the independent directors' approval. 'God, you don't take all that seriously, do you?' Mr. Murdoch answered, according to Mr. Emery." Murdoch eventually forced out Evans.WSJ, Calling the shots: In Murdoch's career, a hand in the news; his aggressive style can blur boundaries; 'Buck stops with me', by Steve Stecklow, Aaron O.

In 2011, The Guardian found evidence that the Journal had artificially inflated its European sales numbers, by paying Executive Learning Partnership for purchasing 16% of European sales. These inflated sales numbers then enabled the Journal to charge similarly inflated advertising rates, as the advertisers would think that they reached more readers than they actually did. In addition, the Journal agreed to run "articles" featuring Executive Learning Partnership, presented as news, but effectively advertising.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/oct/12/wall-street-journal-andrew-langhoff|title=Wall Street Journal circulation scam claims senior Murdoch executive|date=October 12, 2011|accessdate=2011-10-13|location=London|work=The Guardian|first=Nick|last=Davies[/tpl] The case came to light after a Belgian Wall Street Journal employee, Gert Van Mol, informed Dow Jones CEO Les Hinton, about the questionable practice.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/news-corp-wall-street-journal-phone-hacking-250764|title= News Corp Ignored Wall Street Journal Circulation Inflation (Report)|date=October 12, 2011|accessdate=2011-10-13|location=US|work=The Hollywood Reporter|first= THR |last=Staff[/tpl] As a result the then European Wall Street Journal CEO and Publisher Andrew Langhoff was fired after it was found out he personally pressured journalists into covering one of the newspaper’s business partners involved in the issue.[tpl]cite news|url= http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/mediawire/149205/wall-street-journal-europe-publisher-resigns-after-deal-suggested-outside-influence-over-editorial-content/|title= WSJ Europe publisher resigns after reports he ‘personally pressured’ journalists into covering paper’s business partner|date=October 13, 2011|accessdate=2011-10-13|location=US|work=Pointer.|first=Steve|last=Meyers[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203499704576625162816696954.html|title= Publisher of WSJ Europe Resigns After Ethics Inquiry|date=October 12, 2011|accessdate=2011-10-13|location=London|work=WSJ Online|first=Paul|last=Sonne[/tpl] Since September 2011 all the online articles that resulted from the ethical wrongdoing carry a Wall Street Journal disclaimer informing the readers about the circumstances in which they were created.

==Editorial page==

The Journal won its first two Pulitzer Prizes for editorial writing in 1947 and 1953. Subsequent Pulitzer Prizes have been awarded for editorial writing to Robert L. Bartley in 1980 and Joseph Rago in 2011; for criticism to Manuela Hoelterhoff in 1983 and Joe Morgenstern in 2005; and for commentary to Vermont Royster in 1984, Paul Gigot in 2000, Dorothy Rabinowitz in 2001, and Bret Stephens in 2013.
Two summaries published in 1995 by the progressive blog Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, and in 1996 by the Columbia Journalism Review[tpl]cite web|last=Naureckas|first=Jim|last2=Rendall|first2=Steve|title=20 Reasons Not to Trust the Journal Editorial Page|url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1325|work=Extra!|publisher=Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting|date=September–October 1995[/tpl][tpl]cite web|last=Lieberman|first=Trudy|title=Bartley's Believe It Or Not!|url=http://backissues.cjrarchives.org/year/96/4/wsj.asp|work=Columbia Journalism Review|date=July–August 1996[/tpl] criticized the Journal's editorial page for inaccuracy during the 1980s and 1990s.
The Journal describes the history of its editorials:
[tpl]quote|They are united by the mantra "free markets and free people", the principles, if you will, marked in the watershed year of 1776 by Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence and Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations. So over the past century and into the next, the Journal stands for free trade and sound money; against confiscatory taxation and the ukases of kings and other collectivists; and for individual autonomy against dictators, bullies and even the tempers of momentary majorities. If these principles sound unexceptionable in theory, applying them to current issues is often unfashionable and controversial.[tpl]Citation needed|date=August 2011[/tpl][/tpl]
Its historical position was much the same. As former editor William H. Grimes wrote in 1951:
[tpl]quote|On our editorial page we make no pretense of walking down the middle of the road. Our comments and interpretations are made from a definite point of view. We believe in the individual, in his wisdom and his decency. We oppose all infringements on individual rights, whether they stem from attempts at private monopoly, labor union monopoly or from an overgrowing government. People will say we are conservative or even reactionary. We are not much interested in labels but if we were to choose one, we would say we are radical. Just as radical as the Christian doctrine.[tpl]cite news|last=Grimes|first=William H.|title=A Newspaper's Philosophy|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=Jan 2, 1951|location=New York, NY[/tpl] seen in [tpl]cite web|title=A Newspaper's Philosophy |url=http://www.dowjones.com/Products_Services/PrintPublishing/Grimes.htm |work=Dow Jones|publisher=Dow Jones & Company |accessdate=Aug 26, 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070716005137/http://www.dowjones.com/Products_Services/PrintPublishing/Grimes.htm |archivedate=Jul 16, 2007|year=2007[/tpl][/tpl]
Every Thanksgiving the editorial page prints two famous articles that have appeared there since 1961. The first is titled The Desolate Wilderness, and describes what the Pilgrims saw when they arrived at the Plymouth Colony. The second is titled And the Fair Land, and describes the bounty of America. It was written by a former editor, Vermont C. Royster, whose Christmas article In Hoc Anno Domini, has appeared every December 25 since 1949.

===Economic views===

During the Reagan administration, the newspaper's editorial page was particularly influential as the leading voice for supply-side economics. Under the editorship of Robert Bartley, it expounded at length on economic concepts such as the Laffer curve, and how a decrease in certain marginal tax rates and the capital gains tax could allegedly increase overall tax revenue by generating more economic activity.
In the economic argument of exchange rate regimes (one of the most divisive issues among economists), the Journal has a tendency to support fixed exchange rates over floating exchange rates. For example, the Journal was a major supporter of the Chinese yuan's peg to the dollar, and strongly disagreed with American politicians who criticized the Chinese government about the peg. It opposed China's move to let the yuan gradually float, arguing that the fixed rate benefited both the United States and China.
The Journal's views compare with those of the British publication The Economist, with its emphasis on free markets [tpl]Citation needed|date=July 2009[/tpl]. However, the Journal demonstrates important distinctions from European business newspapers, most particularly in regard to the relative significance of, and causes of, the American budget deficit. (The Journal generally points to the lack of foreign growth, while business journals in Europe and Asia blame the low savings rate and concordant high borrowing rate in the United States).

===Political views===

The editorial board has long argued for a pro-business immigration policy. In a July 3, 1984 editorial, the board wrote: If Washington still wants to 'do something' about immigration, we propose a five-word constitutional amendment: There shall be open borders.' This stand on immigration reform places the Journal as an opponent of most conservative activists and politicians, for example National Review, who favor heightened restrictions on immigration.[tpl]cite news|last=Rutenberg |first=Jim |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/03/washington/03immig.html?_r=1&hp=&adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1180807796-2rtP/ypH5CxbIhLG9/DQjg&oref=slogin |title=The editorial page commonly publishes pieces by U.S. and world leaders in academia, business, government and politics |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=June 3, 2007 |accessdate=2011-06-05[/tpl]

==Reporting bias==

The Journal's editors stress the independence and impartiality of their reporters. In a 2004 study, Tim Groseclose and Jeff Milyo calculated the ideological bias of 20 media outlets by counting the frequency they cited particular think tanks and comparing that to the frequency that legislators cited the same think tanks. They found that the news reporting of The Journal was the most liberal, more liberal than NPR or The New York Times. The study did not factor in editorials.[tpl]cite doi|10.1162/003355305775097542[/tpl] Mark Liberman criticized the model used to calculate bias in the study and argued that the model unequally affected liberals and conservatives and that "think tank ideology...only matters to liberals."[tpl]cite web| last = Liberman| first = Mark| title = Linguistics, Politics, Mathematics| publisher=Language Log| date = Dec 22, 2005| url = http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002723.html| accessdate = Nov 6, 2006[/tpl]
The company's planned and eventual acquisition by News Corp. in 2007 led to significant media criticism and discussion about whether the news pages would exhibit a rightward slant under Rupert Murdoch. An August 1 editorial responded to the questions by asserting that Murdoch intended to "maintain the values and integrity of the Journal."

==Notable stories and Pulitzer Prizes==

The Journal has won more than 30 Pulitzer Prizes in its history. Staff journalists who led some of the newspaper's best-known coverage teams have later published books that summarized and extended their reporting.

===1987: RJR Nabisco buyout===

In 1987, a bidding war ensued between several financial firms for tobacco and food giant RJR Nabisco. Bryan Burrough and John Helyar documented the events in more than two dozen Journal articles. Burrough and Helyar later used these articles as the basis of a bestselling book, Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco, which was turned into a film for HBO.[tpl]IMDb title|id=0106356|title=Barbarians at the Gate[/tpl]

===1988: Insider trading===

In the 1980s, Journal reporter James B. Stewart brought national attention to the illegal practice of insider trading. He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in explanatory journalism in 1988, which he shared with Daniel Hertzberg,1988 Pulitzer Prize Retrieved August 19, 2006. who went on to serve as the paper's senior deputy managing editor before resigning in 2009. Stewart expanded on this theme in his book, Den of Thieves.

===2001: 9/11===

The Wall Street Journal claims to have sent the first news report, on the Dow Jones wire, of a plane crashing into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.[tpl]cite web|author= |url=http://mediaweek.co.uk/news/662527/Raymond-Snoddy-Media-Logic-says-WSJ-safe-Murdoch/ |title=Raymond Snoddy on Media: Logic says WSJ is safe with Murdoch |publisher=Mediaweek.co.uk |date=2007-06-06 |accessdate=2011-06-05[/tpl] Its headquarters, at One World Financial Center, was severely damaged by the collapse of the World Trade Center just across the street.Bussey, John. "The Eye of the Storm: One Journey Through Desperation and Chaos". The Wall Street Journal, page A1, September 12, 2001. Retrieved August 8, 2007. Top editors worried that they might miss publishing the first issue for the first time in the paper's 112-year history. They relocated to a makeshift office at an editor's home, while sending most of the staff to Dow Jones's South Brunswick, N.J., corporate campus, where the paper had established emergency editorial facilities soon after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The paper was on the stands the next day, albeit in scaled-down form. Perhaps the most compelling story in that day's edition was a first-hand account of the Twin Towers' collapse written by then-Foreign Editor (and current Washington bureau chief) John Bussey, who holed up in a ninth-floor Journal office, literally in the shadow of the towers, from where he phoned in live reports to CNBC as the towers burned. He narrowly escaped serious injury when the first tower collapsed, shattering all the windows in the Journal's offices and filling them with dust and debris. The Journal won a 2002 Pulitzer Prize in Breaking News Reporting for that day's stories.Pulitzer Prize Winners: 2002 – Breaking News, retrieved August 8, 2007.
The Journal subsequently conducted a worldwide investigation of the causes and significance of 9/11, using contacts it had developed while covering business in the Arab world. In Kabul, Afghanistan, a The Wall Street Journal reporter bought a pair of looted computers that Al Qaeda leaders had used to plan assassinations, chemical and biological attacks, and mundane daily activities. The encrypted files were decrypted and translated.Cullison, Alan, and Andrew Higgins. "Forgotten Computer Reveals Thinking Behind Four Years of Al Qaeda Doings".
