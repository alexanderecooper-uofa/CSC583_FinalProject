==Career==

===Child actress===

It was in New Zealand in 1991 that Paquin became an actress. Director Jane Campion was looking for a little girl to play a main role in The Piano, set to film in New Zealand, and a newspaper advertisement was run announcing an open audition. Paquin's sister read the ad and went to try out with a friend; this inspired Paquin to also audition. When Campion met Paquin—whose only acting experience had been as a skunk in a school play—she was very impressed with the nine-year-old's performance of the monologue about Flora's father, and she was chosen from among the 5000 candidates.
When The Piano was released in 1993 it was lauded by critics, won prizes at a number of film festivals, and eventually became a popular film among a wide audience. Paquin's debut performance in the film earned her the 1993 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress at the age of 11, making her the second-youngest Oscar winner in history, behind Tatum O'Neal. The Piano was made as a small independent film and wasn't expected to be widely known, and Paquin and her family did not plan to continue in the acting circles. However, she was invited to the William Morris Agency, and she kept receiving offers for new roles. She systematically refused them, but she did appear in three commercials for the phone company MCI in 1994.[tpl]cite news|location=New York|date=5 January 2006|title=Verizon and MCI Close Merger, Creating a Stronger Competitor for Advanced Communications Services|url=http://newscenter.verizon.com/press-releases/verizon/2006/page-29672197.html|publisher=Verizon Communications[/tpl] She later made a series of television commercials for Manitoba Telecom Systems in her birth city of Winnipeg.[tpl]cite web |url=http://djuna.cine21.com/anna/27.html |work=CNW Group |date=6 October 1997 |title=Anna Paquin to be MTS's Celebrity Spokesperson Academy Award Winning Actor Stars in MTS Commercials Beginning Today |accessdate=29 August 2011 |location=Winnipeg[/tpl] She also appeared as a voice in an audio book entitled The Magnificent Nose in 1994.

But like many things in the editing process, it was an embarrassment of riches and it was just one of the things that had to go. Unfortunately, it was the one and only sequence Anna Paquin was in, the Rogue character was in. Even though she’s in the materials and part of the process of making the film, she won’t appear in it.” He then later added, “She did a fantastic job,” and that “She was awesome in the sequence. She’s a brilliant actress. I would work with her in a heartbeat.” The following month, Singer confirmed that Paquin is still in the film.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/xmen/rogue.asp |title=Empire X-Men: Days Of Future Past Exclusive - Rogue Cover|accessdate=January 30, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=39967 |title=Bryan Singer On Rogue Being Cut From X-Men: Days of Future Past|author=Plumb, Ali|date=January 30, 2014|accessdate=January 30, 2014[/tpl] In April 2014, 20th century Fox revealed that Paquin's role in the film was "essentially, a cameo."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=117225 |title=Anna Paquin's Rogue Will be Present for X-Men: Days of Future Past|date=April 16, 2014|accessdate=April 16, 2014[/tpl]

But like many things in the editing process, it was an embarrassment of riches and it was just one of the things that had to go. Unfortunately, it was the one and only sequence Anna Paquin was in, the Rogue character was in. Even though she’s in the materials and part of the process of making the film, she won’t appear in it.” He then later added, “She did a fantastic job,” and that “She was awesome in the sequence. She’s a brilliant actress. I would work with her in a heartbeat.” The following month, Singer confirmed that Paquin is still in the film.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/xmen/rogue.asp |title=Empire X-Men: Days Of Future Past Exclusive - Rogue Cover|accessdate=January 30, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=39967 |title=Bryan Singer On Rogue Being Cut From X-Men: Days of Future Past|author=Plumb, Ali|date=January 30, 2014|accessdate=January 30, 2014[/tpl] In April 2014, 20th century Fox revealed that Paquin's role in the film was "essentially, a cameo."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=117225 |title=Anna Paquin's Rogue Will be Present for X-Men: Days of Future Past|date=April 16, 2014|accessdate=April 16, 2014[/tpl]

The True Colours Fund was created to “inspire and engage everyone, especially straight people, to become active participants in the advancement of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender equality”.Official True Colors Fund website The video features Anna Paquin stating, "I'm Anna Paquin. I'm bisexual, and I give a damn".[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/01/anna-paquin-im-bisexual_n_521444.html|title=Anna Paquin: I'm Bisexual (VIDEO)|date=1 June 2010|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=11 May 2012[/tpl] When asked about her participation in the video, Paquin responded by saying, "It wasn't like it was a big secret, it was just a cause I cared about and privately supported, but not one that I had ever had an opportunity to speak out about in a way that would be useful. Obviously I know that one person's voice doesn't necessarily do that much, but I just wanted to do my bit."[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/06/04/anna-paquin-why-i-came-ou_n_601160.html|title=Anna Paquin: Why I Came Out As Bisexual|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=4 June 2010|accessdate=11 May 2012[/tpl] In May 2012, in a Us Weekly interview Paquin shoots down the  notion that bisexuality is a choice. "My sexuality is not made up, for a bisexual, it's not about gender. That's not the deciding factor to who they're attracted to," stated Paquin.[tpl]cite web|author=Beth Anne Macaluso |title=Pregnant Anna Paquin: My Bisexuality Is Not "Made Up" |work=usmagazine.com |date=3 May 2012 |url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/anna-paquin-my-bisexuality-is-not-a-choice-201235[/tpl]
