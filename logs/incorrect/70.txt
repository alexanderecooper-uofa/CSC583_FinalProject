ANSWER TEXT:

CATEGORIES: Human-powered vehicles, Vehicles for hire

The rickshaw began as a two or three-wheeled passenger cart, called a pulled rickshaw, generally pulled by one man with one passenger. The first known use of the term was in 1887.[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rickshaw | title=Rickshaw | publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated | accessdate=April 10, 2013[/tpl] Over time, cycle rickshaws, also called pedicabs, auto rickshaws and solar rickshaws were invented.
Pulled rickshaws created a popular form of transportation, and a source of employment for male laborers, within Asian cities in the 19th century. Their popularity declined as cars, trains and other forms of transportation became widely available.
Auto rickshaws are becoming more popular in some cities in the 21st century as an alternative to taxis because of their low cost.

==Etymology==

The word rickshaw originates from the Japanese word jinrikisha ([tpl]lang|ja|人力車[/tpl], [tpl]lang|ja|人[/tpl] jin = human, [tpl]lang|ja|力[/tpl] riki = power or force, [tpl]lang|ja|車[/tpl] sha = vehicle), which literally means "human-powered vehicle".[tpl]cite book|last=Chamberlain|first=Basil Hall|title=Things Japanese: being notes on various subjects connected with Japan for the use of travellers and others|year=1891|publisher=K.

==History==

===Origin===

Rickshaws are believed to have been invented in Japan in 1869, after the lifting of a ban on wheeled vehicles from the Tokugawa period (1603-1868),[tpl]cite book | title=Japan | publisher=Lonely Planet | author=Chris Rowthorn | year=2007 | pages=44 | isbn=174104667X | editor=Chris Rowthorn | edition=10[/tpl] and at the beginning of a rapid period of technical advancement in Japan.[tpl]cite book | title=Rickshaw Coolie: A People's History of Singapore, 1880-1940 | publisher=NUS Press | author=James Francis Warren | pages=14 | isbn=997169266X [/tpl][tpl]cite book | title=Amazing . . .

====Inventor====

There are several theories about the inventor.{{#tag:ref|There are several theories about the inventor.
 Though the origins of the rickshaw are not entirely clear, they seem to be Japanese, and of Tokyo specifically. The most widely accepted theory offers the name of three inventors, and gives 1869 as the date of invention.[tpl]cite book | title=Beyond the Neon Lights: Everyday Shanghai in the Early Twentieth Century | publisher=University of California Press | author=Hanchao Lu | location=1999 | pages=348 | isbn=0520215648[/tpl] 

===Description===

The vehicle had a wooden carriage that rode on "superior Western wheels" and was a dramatic improvement over earlier modes of transportation. Whereas the earlier sedan chairs required two people, the rickshaw generally only required one. More than one person was required for hilly or mountainous areas. It was also a smoother ride for the passenger. Other forms of vehicles at the time were drawn by animals or were wheelbarrows.
The Powerhouse Museum has had a rickshaw in their collection for 120 years. It was made about 1880 and is described as:
 A rickshaw, or Jinrikisha, is a light, two-wheeled cart consisting of a doorless, chairlike body, mounted on springs with a collapsible hood and two shafts. Finished in black lacquer-ware over timber, it was drawn by a single rickshaw runner. 

===Late 19th century===

It became an inexpensive, popular mode of transportation across Asia. Peasants who migrated to large Asian cities often worked first as a rickshaw runner. It was "the deadliest occupation in the East, and the most degrading for human beings to pursue."[tpl]#tag:ref|In China, coolies performed rickshaw pulling. Other hard or demeaning jobs included being night soil cleaners and dock workers.|group="nb"[/tpl]

====Japan====

Starting in 1870, the Tokyo government issued a permission to build and sell rickshaws to the trio that are believed in Asia to be the rickshaw's inventors: Izumi Yosuke, Takayama Kosuke, and Suzuki Tokujiro. In order to operate a rickshaw in Tokyo, a seal was required from these men. By 1872, they replaced the palanquins and became the main mode of transportation in Japan, with about 40,000 rickshaws in service. At that time man-power was much cheaper than horse-power; horses were generally only used by the military. Some of the rickshaws were artistically decorated with paintings and rear elevations. In this time, the more exuberant styles of decorations were banned.[tpl]cite book | title=Tokyo from Edo to Showa | publisher=Tuttle Classics | author=Edward Seidensticker | year=2010 | pages=59 [/tpl] If the families were well-off financially they might have their own rickshaw runner.

Japanese rickshaw manufacturers produced and exported rickshaws to Asian countries and South Africa.

====Singapore====

Singapore had received its first rickshaws in 1880 and soon after they were prolific, making a "noticeable change in the traffic on Singapore's streets." Bullock carts and gharries were used prior to the introduction of rickshaws.[tpl]cite book | title=Chinese Adaptation and Diversity: Essays on Society and Literature in Indonesia, Malaysia & Singapore | publisher=NUS Press | author=Leo Suryadinata | year=1992 | pages=37 | isbn=9971691868 | agency=National University of Singapore.

Many of the poorest individuals in Singapore in the late nineteenth century were poverty-stricken, unskilled people of Chinese ancestry. Sometimes called coolies, the hardworking men found that pulling a rickshaw was a new opportunity for employment.[tpl]cite book | title=Rickshaw Coolie: A People's History of Singapore, 1880-1940 | publisher=NUS Press | author=James Francis Warren | pages=15 | isbn=997169266X [/tpl]

In China, the rickshaw was first seen in 1873 and was used for public transportation the following year. Within a year, there were 10,000 rickshaws in operation.Beyond the Neon Lights: Everyday Shanghai in the Early Twentieth Century Around 1880, rickshaws appeared in India, first introduced in Simla by Reverend J.

===20th century===

After World War II, there was a major shift in the use of man-powered rickshaws:
 Hand-pulled rickshaws became an embarrassment to modernizing urban elites in the Third World, and were widely banned, in part because they were symbolic, not of modernity, but of a feudal world of openly marked class distinctions. Perhaps the seated rickshaw passenger is too close to the back of the laboring driver, who, besides, is metaphorically a draught animal harnessed between shafts.[tpl]cite book | title=Critical Mass: bicycling's defiant celebration | publisher=AK Press | author=Chris Carlsson | year=2002 | pages=171 | isbn=1902593596[/tpl] 
The cycle rickshaw was built in the 1880s and was first used with regularity starting in 1929 in Singapore. They were found in every south and east Asian country by 1950.

====Asia====

The rickshaw's popularity in Japan declined by the 1930s with the advent of automated forms of transportation, like automobiles and trains. After the World War II, when gasoline and automobiles were scarce, they made a temporary come-back. The rickshaw tradition has stayed alive in Kyoto and Tokyo's geisha districts. In the 1990s, German-made cycle rickshaws called velotaxis were introduced in Japanese cities, including Kobe.
In China, the rickshaw's popularity began to decline in the 1920s[tpl]cite book | title=The Bizarre and the Wondrous from the Land of the Rising Sun! | publisher=Cultural-Insight Books | author=Boye De Mente | year=2010 | isbn=1456424750 | editor=Demetra De Ment | pages=95 [/tpl] and particularly as a mode of passenger transportation by the 1950s. A rough form of a rickshaw is sometimes for hauling coal, building materials or other material. Both motorized and pedal-power cycle rickshaws, or pedicabs, were used for short distance passenger travel.[tpl]cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2WM23qDdOGQC&pg=PT61 | title=China Travel Guide - Tiki Travel | publisher=FB Editions | pages=PT61 | isbn=9791021306523[/tpl]
In Singapore, the rickshaws popularity increased into the 20th century. There were approximately 50,000 rickshaws in 1920 and that number doubled by 1930. Cycle rickshaws were used in Singapore beginning in 1929. Within six years pulled rickshaws were outnumbered by cycle rickshaws, which were also used by sightseeing tourists.Suryadinata (1992). p. 40.[tpl]#tag:ref|Other means of transportation in Singapore are  buses, lorries and trams.|group="nb"[/tpl]
In the 1930s cycle rickshaws were used in Kolkata, India; Jakarta, Indonesia; and Dhaka, Bangladesh. By 1950 they could be found in the countries of south and east Asia. By the end of the century there were 300,000 such vehicles in Dhaka.[tpl]cite book | title=The Shock of the Old: Technology and Global History Since 1900 | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=David Edgerton | year=2011 | pages=46–47 | isbn=0199832617[/tpl]

The 21st century has seen a resurgence in rickshaws, this time in auto rickshaws, also called velotaxis, because they are about 1/3 to 1/2 the cost of regular taxis.

Phnom Penh National Olympic Stadium ([tpl]lang-km|ពហុកីឡដ្ឋានជាតិអូឡាំពិក[/tpl]) is a multi-purpose stadium in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. It has a capacity of 50,000 seats, but can expand up to 80,000. 

==History==

Construction on the National Sports Complex started in 1963 and was completed in 1964.Khmer Architecture Tours, retrieved 2007-11-25 Designer Vann Molyvann made use of massive earthworks to create the stadium, digging up 500,000 cubic meters of earth to shape the grounds.Deconstructing Cambodia's modernist heritage, Asia Times Online; retrieved 2007-11-25
The stadium might have been built to host the 1963 Southeast Asian Peninsular Games, but the games were cancelled due to political problems in Cambodia. There was also the short-lived GANEFO games, that were held in Phnom Penh, Cambodia in November 25~December 6, 1966 and were named 'First Asian GANEFO'.  The stadium did play host to appearances by visiting dignitaries and state occasions, and was the home of Cambodia's national athletics teams.
The stadium played a small part in the 1966 FIFA World Cup. Unexpectedly, North Korea faced Australia in a qualifier. Because North Korea lacked dipomatic relations with most countries, finding a suitable venue for the match proved difficult, until Head of State Norodom Sihanouk, an ally of Kim Il-sung, said the matches could be held in Phnom Penh. The matches attracted 40,000 fans, with Sihounouk decreeing half would cheer for Australia, while the other half cheered the Koreans.  The matches were held on 21 November 1965 and on 24 November 1965 with North Korea winning both (6–1 and 3–1). Because South Korea and all African teams had withdrawn in protests against FIFA, North Korea were thus directly qualified to the final tournament, where they reached the quarter-final.The greatest story never told, Ron Gluckman; retrieved 2008-01-151966 Qualifying Competition, Planet World Cup; retrieved 2007-01-15
Among the facilities are Olympic-size pools for swimming and diving and an indoor volley-ball court with a capacity of up to 8,000, now known as the Olympic Stadium Indoor Arena.
During the Khmer Rouge era, the stadium was used as an execution site where officials of the Khmer Republic formerly led by Lon Nol were killed.Notes from Cambodia, Rich Garella; retrieved 2007-11-25
In the decades following the Khmer Rouge era, the stadium facilities fell into disrepair. In 2000 the stadium complex was redeveloped by a Taiwanese firm, the Yuanta Group, which refurbished the stadium but also redeveloped parcels of the complex into condominiums and commercial properties.Illegal disposals of state property, CambodiaPolitic.org; retrieved 2007-11-25Building Phnom Penh: An Angkorian heritage, Robert Turnbull, International Herald Tribune; retrieved 2007-11-25
As of 2007, the stadium has come to be a popular attraction for Phnom Penh residents, who attend daily exercise sessions, as well as football games and other activities.
