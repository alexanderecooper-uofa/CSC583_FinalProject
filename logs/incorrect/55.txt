The Mercedes-Benz Superdome (originally Louisiana Superdome and commonly The Superdome) is a domed sports and exhibition venue, located in the Central Business District of New Orleans, Louisiana, USA. Plans were drawn up in 1967, by the New Orleans modernist architectural firm of Curtis and Davis. Its steel frame covers a [tpl]Convert|13|acre|adj=on[/tpl] expanse. Its [tpl]Convert|273|ft|m|adj=on[/tpl] dome is made of a lamellar multi-ringed frame and has a diameter of [tpl]Convert|680|ft|m[/tpl], making it the largest fixed domed structure in the world.The Superdome in New Orleans It is adjacent to the Smoothie King Center.
Because of the size and location in one of the major tourist destinations in the United States, the Superdome routinely makes the "short list" of candidates being considered for major sporting events, such as the Super Bowl, College Football Championship Game and the Final Four. It is the home stadium of the New Orleans Saints American football team.
In 2005, the Superdome gained international attention of a different type when it housed thousands of people seeking shelter from Hurricane Katrina.  The building suffered extensive damage as a result of the storm, and was closed for many months afterward.
On October 3, 2011, it was announced that German automaker Mercedes-Benz purchased naming rights to the stadium. The new name took effect on October 23, 2011.[tpl]cite news|last=Woodyard|first=Chris|title=Mercedes-Benz buys naming rights to New Orleans' Superdome|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/driveon/post/2011/10/mercedes-benz-new-orleans-superdome-naming-rights-saints-bcs-super-bowl-2013/1|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=October 4, 2011|date=October 4, 2011[/tpl] It is the third stadium that has naming rights from Mercedes-Benz (and first in the United States), after the Mercedes-Benz Arena, the stadium of Bundesliga club VfB Stuttgart, in Stuttgart, Germany and the Mercedes-Benz Arena in Shanghai, China.

==Description==

The Superdome is located on [tpl]Convert|52|acre[/tpl] of land, including the former Girod Street Cemetery. The dome has an interior space of [tpl]Convert|125000000|cuft|m3|-5[/tpl], a height of [tpl]Convert|253|ft|m|1[/tpl], a dome diameter of [tpl]Convert|680|ft|m|1[/tpl], and a total floor area of [tpl]Convert|269000|sqft|m2|0[/tpl].

===Capacity===

The Superdome has a listed football seating capacity of 76,468 (expanded) or 73,208 (not expanded) and a maximum basketball seating capacity of 73,432. However, published attendance figures from events such as the Sugar Bowl football game have exceeded 79,000. The basketball capacity does not reflect the NCAA's new policy on arranging the basketball court on the 50-yard line on the football field, per 2009 NCAA policy.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/basketball+resources/seating+configuration+at+the+final+four|work=NCAA|title=Basketball Resources|date=January 2, 2012[/tpl] In 2011, 3,500 seats were added, increasing the Superdome's capacity to 76,468.

Home field advantage Since the Superdome's reopening in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and the increased success of the New Orleans Saints, the Superdome has developed a reputation for having a very strong home field advantage.  While all domed stadiums possess this quality to some degree, the Superdome is known to get extremely loud during games, especially during offensive drives by the visiting team.
During a pregame interview before the Minnesota Vikings' opening game of the 2010 NFL season against the Saints, Brett Favre, reflecting on the Vikings' loss to the Saints in the 2009–10 NFC Championship Game, said of the Superdome: "That was, by far, the most hostile environment I've ever been in.  You couldn't hear anything."  It was during that loss that some of the Vikings players elected to wear earplugs, including Favre.  It was the first game of the season that they had chosen to do so.St. Paul Pioneer Press

==Stadium history==

===Planning===

Sports visionary David Dixon (who decades later founded the United States Football League) conceived of the Superdome while attempting to convince the NFL to award a franchise to New Orleans. After hosting several exhibition games at Tulane Stadium during typical New Orleans summer thunderstorms, Dixon was told by NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle that the NFL would never expand into New Orleans without a domed stadium. Dixon then won the support of the governor of Louisiana, John McKeithen. When they toured the Astrodome in Houston, Texas in 1966, McKeithen was quoted as saying, "I want one of these, only bigger," in reference to the Astrodome itself. Bonds were passed for construction of the Superdome on November 8, 1966, seven days after commissioner Pete Rozelle awarded New Orleans the 25th professional football franchise. The stadium was conceptualized to be a multifunctional stadium for football, baseball and basketball moveable field level stands that would be arranged specifically for each sport and areas with dirt (for the bases and pitchers mound) covered with metal plates on the stadium floor (they were covered by the artificial turf during football games) and there are also Meeting Rooms that could be rented for many different purposes. Dixon imagined the possibilities of staging simultaneous high school football games side-by-side and suggested that the synthetic surface be white.[tpl]cite news |title=Louisiana Plans Functional Stadium|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 11, 1967|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20716F93D5B107B93C3A8178DD85F438685F9|page=215[/tpl] Blount International of Montgomery, Alabama was chosen to build the stadium.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/goe/eagle_bios/2001/blount_2001.asp|title=Air University: Eagle Biography: Winton M. "Red" Blount|publisher=Au.af.mil|accessdate=December 14, 2011[/tpl]
As the dome was being constructed, various individuals developed eccentric models of the structure: one was of sugar, another consisted of pennies. The so-called "penny model" traveled to the Philadelphia Bicentennial '76 exhibition. New Orleanian Norman J. Kleintz built the model with 2,697 pennies and donated it to the Superdome Board of Commissioners in April, 1974.Louisiana Superdome Newsletter 5:7 (August 1976) and III:4 (April 15 1974).
It was hoped the stadium would be ready in time for the 1972 NFL season, and the final cost of the facility would come in at $46 million. Instead, due to political delays, construction did not start until August 11, 1971, and was not finished until August 1975, seven months after Super Bowl IX was scheduled to be played in the stadium. Since the stadium was not finished in time for the Super Bowl, the game had to be moved to Tulane Stadium, and was played in cold and rainy conditions. Factoring in inflation, construction delays, and the increase in transportation costs caused by the 1973 oil crisis, the final price tag of the stadium skyrocketed to $165 million. Along with the state police, Elward Thomas Brady, Jr., a state representative from Terrebonne Parish and a New Orleans native, conducted an investigation into possible financial irregularities, but the Superdome went forward despite the obstacles.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.houmatoday.com/article/20070408/NEWS/704080322?p=3&tc=pg|title=Robert Morris, "Local businessman, former legislator dies", April 8, 2007|publisher=houmatoday.com|accessdate=July 14, 2013[/tpl]

===Early History (1975-1999)===

First Saints game The New Orleans Saints opened the 1975 NFL season at the Superdome, losing 21–0 to the Cincinnati Bengals in the first regular-season game in the facility. Tulane Stadium, the original home of the Saints, was condemned for destruction on the day the Superdome opened.
First Super Bowl The first Super Bowl played in the stadium was Super Bowl XII in January 1978, the first in prime time.
Original turf The original artificial turf playing surface in the Superdome was produced by Monsanto specifically for the Superdome and was named "Mardi Grass."

===2000-2009===

Effect of Hurricane Katrina
The Superdome was used as a "shelter of last resort" for those in New Orleans unable to evacuate from Hurricane Katrina when it struck in late August 2005. During the storm, a large section of the outer covering was peeled off by high winds. The photos of the damage, in which the concrete underneath was exposed, quickly became an iconic image of Hurricane Katrina. A few days later the dome was closed until September 25, 2006.
Reopening after Katrina
The Superdome cost $185 million to repair and refurbish. To repair the Superdome, FEMA put up $115 million,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/9673908/1|title=Superdome returns with glitz, glamor and Monday night football|date=September 20, 2006|publisher=CBS Sports|accessdate=August 6, 2009[/tpl] the state spent $13 million, the Louisiana Stadium & Expedition District refinanced a bond package to secure $41 million and the NFL contributed $15 million.
After being damaged from the flooding disaster, a new Sportexe MomentumTurf surface was installed for the 2006 season.
On Super Bowl XL Sunday (February 5, 2006), the NFL announced that the Saints would play their home opener on September 24, 2006 in the Superdome against the Atlanta Falcons. The game was later moved to Monday night, September 25.
The reopening of the dome was celebrated with festivities including a free outdoor concert by the Goo Goo Dolls before fans were allowed in, a pre-game performance by the rock bands U2 and Green Day performing a cover of The Skids' "The Saints Are Coming", and a coin toss conducted by former President George H. W. Bush. In front of ESPN's largest-ever audience at that time, the Saints won the game 23–3 with 70,003 in attendance and went on to a successful season reaching their first ever NFC Championship Game.
The first bowl game played in the Superdome after Katrina was the New Orleans Bowl won by the Troy Trojans 41–17 over the Rice Owls.
Renovations
In early 2006, the Superdome began a $320 million renovation that consisted of three remodeling phases. First, the stadium was repaired and refurbished from damage suffered during Hurricane Katrina. In 2008, new windows were installed to bring natural light into the building. Later that year, the roof-facing of the Superdome was also remodeled, restoring the roof with a solid white hue. Between 2009 and 2010, the entire outer layer of the stadium, more than [tpl]convert|400000|sqft|m2[/tpl] of aluminum siding, was replaced with new aluminum panels and insulation, returning the building to its original champagne bronze colored exterior. An innovative barrier system for drainage was also added, allowing the dome to resemble its original facade.
In addition, escalators were added to the outside of the club rooms. Each suite includes modernized rooms with raised ceilings, leather sofas, and flat-screen TVs, as well as glass brushed aluminum and wood-grain furnishings. A new $600,000 point-of-sale system was also installed, allowing fans to purchase concessions with credit cards throughout the stadium for the first time.

===2010-present===

New turf installation During the summer of 2010 the Superdome installed [tpl]convert|111831|sqft|m2[/tpl] of the Speed S5-M synthetic turf system by UBU Sports. The Superdome now has the largest continuous synthetic turf system in the NFL.
Renovations Beginning in 2011, demolition and new construction began to the lower bowl of the stadium, reconfiguring it to increase seating by 3,500, widening the plaza concourse, building two bunker club lounges and adding additional concession stands. Crews tore down the temporary stairs that lead from Champions Square to the Dome, and replaced them with permanent steps. Installation of express elevators that take coaches and media from the ground level of the stadium to the press box were also completed. New [tpl]convert|7500|sqft|m2|adj=on[/tpl] bunker lounges on each side of the stadium were built. The lounges are equipped with flat-screen TVs, granite counter tops and full-service bars. These state of the art lounges can serve 4,500 fans, whose old plaza seats were upgraded to premium tickets, giving those fans leather chairs with cup-holders. The plaza level was extended, closing in space between the concourse and plaza seating, adding new restrooms and concession areas. The renovations also ended the stadium's ability to convert to a baseball configuration.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/14605228/superdome-gets-makeover-with-big-games-ahead|title=Superdome gets makeover with big games ahead|publisher=CBS[/tpl] The renovations were completed in late June 2011 in time for the Essence Music Festival. With all three phases of the renovation complete, the Superdome is one of the most up-to-date facilities in the U.S.
Naming rights The Superdome had not taken on corporate naming rights until Mercedes-Benz acquired the rights in 2011. Though the stadium is owned by the state of Louisiana, the New Orleans Saints' lease gives the team the authority to sell the rights.[tpl]cite news|title=Mercedes-Benz has Superdome deal|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/7058178/mercedes-benz-buys-naming-rights-superdome-home-new-orleans-saints|agency=Associated Press|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=October 4, 2011|date=October 4, 2011[/tpl] Saints owner Tom Benson also owns Mercedes-Benz dealerships in New Orleans and San Antonio.
[tpl]Visible anchor|Super Bowl XLVII power failure[/tpl] The Superdome hosted the Super Bowl XLVII football game on February 3, 2013. A partial power failure halted game play for about 34 minutes in the third quarter between the Baltimore Ravens and the San Francisco 49ers. It caused CBS, who was broadcasting the game, to lose some of its cameras as well as voiceovers by the commentators. At no point did the game go off the air, though the game had no audio for about two minutes. While the lights were coming back on, CBS reporters deployed around the stadium reported on the outage as a breaking news situation until power was restored enough for play to continue.
On February 8, 2013 it was reported that a relay device intended to prevent an electrical overload had caused the failure.[tpl]cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs/2012/story/_/id/8929106/super-bowl-xlvii-utility-says-bad-device-caused-super-bowl-blackout|work=ESPN.com|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=9 April 2013[/tpl]  The device was located in an electrical vault owned and operated by Entergy, the electrical utility for the New Orleans area. That vault is approximately one quarter mile away from the Superdome.
