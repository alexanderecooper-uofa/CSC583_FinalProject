==Career==

===Child actress===

It was in New Zealand in 1991 that Paquin became an actress. Director Jane Campion was looking for a little girl to play a main role in The Piano, set to film in New Zealand, and a newspaper advertisement was run announcing an open audition. Paquin's sister read the ad and went to try out with a friend; this inspired Paquin to also audition. When Campion met Paquin—whose only acting experience had been as a skunk in a school play—she was very impressed with the nine-year-old's performance of the monologue about Flora's father, and she was chosen from among the 5000 candidates.
When The Piano was released in 1993 it was lauded by critics, won prizes at a number of film festivals, and eventually became a popular film among a wide audience. Paquin's debut performance in the film earned her the 1993 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress at the age of 11, making her the second-youngest Oscar winner in history, behind Tatum O'Neal. The Piano was made as a small independent film and wasn't expected to be widely known, and Paquin and her family did not plan to continue in the acting circles. However, she was invited to the William Morris Agency, and she kept receiving offers for new roles. She systematically refused them, but she did appear in three commercials for the phone company MCI in 1994.[tpl]cite news|location=New York|date=5 January 2006|title=Verizon and MCI Close Merger, Creating a Stronger Competitor for Advanced Communications Services|url=http://newscenter.verizon.com/press-releases/verizon/2006/page-29672197.html|publisher=Verizon Communications[/tpl] She later made a series of television commercials for Manitoba Telecom Systems in her birth city of Winnipeg.[tpl]cite web |url=http://djuna.cine21.com/anna/27.html |work=CNW Group |date=6 October 1997 |title=Anna Paquin to be MTS's Celebrity Spokesperson Academy Award Winning Actor Stars in MTS Commercials Beginning Today |accessdate=29 August 2011 |location=Winnipeg[/tpl] She also appeared as a voice in an audio book entitled The Magnificent Nose in 1994.

Unfortunately, it was the one and only sequence Anna Paquin was in, the Rogue character was in. Even though she’s in the materials and part of the process of making the film, she won’t appear in it.” He then later added, “She did a fantastic job,” and that “She was awesome in the sequence. She’s a brilliant actress. I would work with her in a heartbeat.” The following month, Singer confirmed that Paquin is still in the film.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/xmen/rogue.asp |title=Empire X-Men: Days Of Future Past Exclusive - Rogue Cover|accessdate=January 30, 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=39967 |title=Bryan Singer On Rogue Being Cut From X-Men: Days of Future Past|author=Plumb, Ali|date=January 30, 2014|accessdate=January 30, 2014[/tpl] In April 2014, 20th century Fox revealed that Paquin's role in the film was "essentially, a cameo."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=117225 |title=Anna Paquin's Rogue Will be Present for X-Men: Days of Future Past|date=April 16, 2014|accessdate=April 16, 2014[/tpl]

==Series overview==

The fictional universe depicted in the series is premised on the notion that vampires (and other supernatural creatures) have been living among us, unbeknownst to the majority of humans until two years before the series premiere, when the creation of synthetic blood ("Tru Blood") by Japanese scientists allowed vampires to come out of the coffin (a term coined as a play on "coming out of the closet") and reveal their existence to the world on the basis that they no longer need to feed on humans to survive.[tpl]ref|Strange Love|E-1[/tpl] This so-called 'Great Revelation' has split the vampires of the world into two camps: those who wish to integrate into human society (aka "mainstream") by campaigning for citizenship and equal rights,[tpl]ref|Strange Love|E-1[/tpl] and those who think that human-vampire co-existence is impossible because it is in conflict with the inherently violent nature of vampires. Throughout the series, other supernatural creatures are also introduced, among them shapeshifters, werewolves, fairies, witches and a maenad.
The series revolves around Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin), a telepathic Human-Fairy hybrid known as a halfling (not to be confused with similarly named, but unrelated creatures found in other fantasy works). Sookie is a waitress at Merlotte's Bar and Grill, owned by Sam Merlotte (Sam Trammell) in the small Louisiana town of Bon Temps. Sam is a shapeshifter, though this secret is kept hidden from most of the town. Other characters include Bill Compton (Stephen Moyer), a handsome 173-year-old vampire who has returned to Bon Temps to take up residence in his former home following the death of his last remaining relative; Tara Thornton (Rutina Wesley), Sookie's tough-talking but insecure best friend; Sookie's womanizing brother Jason (Ryan Kwanten); thousand-year-old vampire and Sheriff of Area 5, Eric Northman (Alexander Skarsgård); and Lafayette Reynolds (Nelsan Ellis), a short order cook, drug dealer, road crew member and medium.
The show explores several contemporary issues, such as the struggle for equal rights, discrimination and violence against minorities and homosexuals, the problems of drug addiction, the power of faith and religion, the control/influence of the media, the quest for identity, and the importance of family.

==Production==

===Development history===

Series creator Alan Ball had previously worked with the cable channel HBO on Six Feet Under, which ran for five seasons. In October 2005 after Six Feet Under's series finished, Ball signed a two-year agreement with HBO to develop and produce original programming for the network. True Blood became the first project under the deal, after Ball became acquainted with Charlaine Harris's Southern Vampire Mystery books.[tpl]cite press release |title= Concludes Exclusive Two-Year Television Deal with Six Feet Under Creator Alan Ball |publisher= Time Warner, of which HBO is a subsidiary |date=October 31, 2005 |url=http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,1124432,00.html |accessdate=March 20, 2008[/tpl] One day, while early for a dental appointment, Ball was browsing through a Barnes & Noble bookshop and came across Dead Until Dark, the first installment in Harris's series. He read the entries that followed and became interested in "bringing Harris's vision to television".[tpl]cite news | first=Matt | last=Fowler | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Bloody Bites from True Blood Season 2 | date=June 12, 2001 | publisher=IGN | url =http://tv.ign.com/articles/972/972562p1.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = June 7, 2002[/tpl] However, Harris already had two other adaptation options for the books. She said she chose to work with him, though, because "Ball really 'got' me. That's how he convinced me to go with him. I just felt that he understood what I was doing with the books."
The project's hour-long pilot was ordered concurrently with the finalization of the aforementioned development deal and was written, directed and produced by Ball. Cast members Paquin, Kwanten and Trammell were announced in February 2007 and Masching later on in April.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3i72ff675fda9c3c4bb99995e58e86eb35 |title=Paquin finds 'True' calling for Ball, HBO |accessdate=September 20, 2010 |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |date=February 26, 2007 |work=The Hollywood Reporter[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i168a205d21d443f8bf76f1d49f7d5785 -|title=Moyer, HBO make 'Blood' pact |accessdate=March 20, 2008 |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |date=April 7, 2007 |work=The Hollywood Reporter[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot[/tpl] The pilot was shot in the early summer of 2007 and was officially ordered to series in August, at which point Ball had already written several more episodes.

Conceptually, the sequence was constructed around the idea of "the whore in the house of prayer"[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.creativeleague.com/feature-dks-true-blood-the-making-of/ |title=Feature: DK's True Blood – The Making Of |accessdate=May 2, 2009 |work=Creative League News |publisher=Creative League [/tpl] by intermingling contradictory images of sex, violence and religion and displaying them from the point of view of "a supernatural, predatory creature observing human beings from the shadows ..." Ideas of redemption and forgiveness are also explored, and thus the sequence progresses from morning to night and culminates in a baptism.
The title sequence was created by the independent film company Digital Kitchen. The sequence also features images and themes of death and rebirth; the circle of life.  A Venus fly-trap can be seen engulfing a frog while a rotting fox’s head is sped up to reveal maggots feeding off of the corpse.  Rebirth is also recognized through an image of a woman being "washed clean" from her sins in a lake as well as a Reverend blessing and possibly performing an exorcism on a member of his congregation.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/2008/11/21/true-blood/ |title=True Blood opening title sequence |publisher=Art of the Title |date=November 21, 2008 |accessdate=November 3, 2011[/tpl]
Some of the footage used in the sequence was filmed on location. Digital Kitchen then took a four-day trip to Louisiana to film and also shot at a Chicago church and on a stage and in a bar in Seattle.
In editing the opening, individual frames were also splattered with drops of blood. The sequence's transitions were constructed differently, though; they were made with a Polaroid transfer technique. The last frame of one shot and the first frame of another were taken as a single Polaroid photo, which was then divided between emulsion and backing. The emulsion was then filmed being further separated by chemicals and those shots of this separation were placed back into the final edit.
Eight different typefaces, inspired by Southern road signs, were also created manually for cast and crew credits, as well as the show's title card.
In a 2010 issue of TV Guide, the show's opening title sequence ranked #5 on a list of TV's top 10 credits sequences, as selected by readers.Tomashoff, Craig. "Credits Check" TV Guide, October 18, 2010, Pages 16-17

The show's individual episode titles are named after songs featured in the episodes, usually heard during the closing credits. The title usually indicates something about the events that will unfold throughout the given episode. For example, episode ten of season four is titled "Burning Down the House" and the end credits feature a cover version of the classic Talking Heads song performed by The Used.

===Marketing===

The premiere of True Blood was prefaced with a viral marketing/alternate reality game (ARG) campaign, based at BloodCopy.com. This included setting up multiple websites, encoding web address into unmarked envelopes mailed to high profile blog writers and others, and even performances by a "vampire" who attempted to reach out to others of their kind, to discuss the recent creation of "TrueBlood", a fictional beverage which is featured in the show.
A MySpace account with the username "Blood" had, as of June 19, uploaded two videos; one entitled "Vampire Taste Test – True Blood vs Human", and one called "BloodCopy Exclusive INTERVIEW WITH SAMSON THE VAMPIRE".
A prequel comic was handed out to attendees of the 2008 Comic-Con. The comic centers around an old vampire named Lamar, who tells the reader about how TruBlood surfaced and was discussed between many vampires before going public. At one point, Lamar wonders if TruBlood is making the world safe for vampires or from them. Several commercials featured on HBO and Facebook[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.new.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=608447658860#/video/?id=23768668081 | title=TruBlood's Videos |accessdate=September 14, 2008[/tpl] aired prior to the series premiere, placing vampires in ads similar to those of beer and wine.

==Cast and characters==

True Blood employs a broad ensemble cast composed of regular, central characters and a rotating group of impermanent supporting characters. Though the series is based in the fictional town of Bon Temps, Louisiana, a noticeable number of the actors comprising the cast are originally from outside the United States. In an interview, Ball explained that he didn't intentionally seek out "non-American" actors, but was willing to go anywhere he needed to in order "to find the actor who makes the character breathe". Ball went on to explain that, in casting, there was more of a focus on who would portray the character in a compelling way rather than who would physically resemble the characters from the book. Noting that there's a definite difference between the characters and storylines portrayed in True Blood and the ones depicted in The Southern Vampire Mysteries, he described Harris as being very understanding in terms of how her work was being reinterpreted.

===Core cast===

===Principal cast===

The major characters of the first season of True Blood are introduced among various intertwining plot lines that surround the Bon Temps bar "Merlotte's". The show's main protagonist, Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin), is a telepath and waitress at Merlotte's.[tpl]ref|Strange Love|E-1[/tpl] In the opening episode she saves Merlotte's first vampire customer, Bill Compton (Stephen Moyer), when a local couple attempts to drain him of his blood (vampire blood is known on the show as a human narcotic: "V" or "V Juice").[tpl]ref|Strange Love|E-1[/tpl] Through the relationship that develops between Sookie and Bill, the viewer progressively learns more about vampire culture and the limitations of vampire physiology (e.g. susceptibility to silver and the sun).
The major plot of the first season revolves around the murder of several women connected to Sookie's older brother, Jason (Ryan Kwanten).[tpl]ref|Strange Love|E-1[/tpl] The women murdered include sexual partner Maudette Pickens (Danielle Sapia),[tpl]ref|Strange Love|E-1[/tpl] on-and-off romantic interest and Merlotte's waitress Dawn Green (Lynn Collins),[tpl]ref|Mine|E-3[/tpl] grandmother Adele (Lois Smith) or simply "Gran",[tpl]ref|Sparks|E-5[/tpl] and girlfriend Amy Burley (Lizzy Caplan).[tpl]ref|Love Bury|E-11[/tpl] Though the viewer is always aware of Jason's innocence in their deaths, Detective Andy Bellefleur (Chris Bauer) targets him as the prime suspect in the investigation he conducts with Sheriff Bud Dearborne (William Sanderson) to identify their killer.[tpl]ref|Strange Love|E-1[/tpl] Jason's best friends and co-workers, Hoyt Fortenberry (Jim Parrack) and Rene Lenier (Michael Raymond-James) provide him with support despite the turmoil he encounters.[tpl]ref|Strange Love|E-1[/tpl] Rene, who becomes engaged to Merlotte's waitress Arlene Fowler (Carrie Preston),[tpl]ref|Fourth|E-8[/tpl] is eventually exposed as the Bon Temps murderer and is killed in a final confrontation with Sookie.[tpl]ref|You'll Be|E-12[/tpl]
A secondary plot in the first season (that later develops as the primary storyline in the second) revolves around Sookie's best friend Tara Thornton (Rutina Wesley).[tpl]ref|Strange Love|E-1[/tpl] In the first episode, Tara is hired as a bartender at Merlotte's by bar owner, shapeshifter,[tpl]ref|Don't Wanna|E-11[/tpl] and admirer of Sookie, Sam Merlotte (Sam Trammell),[tpl]ref|Strange Love|E-1[/tpl] with whom Tara later has a brief relationship.[tpl]ref|Mine|E-3[/tpl] Tara's cousin Lafayette Reynolds (Nelsan Ellis) already works as a cook at Merlotte's[tpl]ref|Strange Love|E-1[/tpl] (in addition to several other jobs that include road crew, prostitute, and drug dealer)[tpl]ref|Mine|E-3[/tpl] with Andy's cousin and Iraq War veteran, Terry (Todd Lowe).[tpl]ref|First Taste|E-2[/tpl] Tara's story is characterized by her relationship with her alcoholic and abusive mother Lettie Mae (Adina Porter)[tpl]ref|First Taste|E-2[/tpl] and her own inner "demons".[tpl]ref|Wanna Know|E-10[/tpl] During the season, Lettie Mae achieves sobriety[tpl]ref|Fourth|E-8[/tpl] but Tara's life begins to spin out of control. Kicked out of her home and totaling her car in a drunk driving accident,[tpl]ref|Wanna Know|E-10[/tpl] she's taken in by "social worker" Maryann Forrester (Michelle Forbes).[tpl]ref|Love Bury|E-11[/tpl] While staying with Maryann, Tara is introduced to "Eggs" Benedict Talley (Mehcad Brooks), to whom she becomes attracted.[tpl]ref|Love Bury|E-11[/tpl]
The final major plotline of the first season revolves around the elements of vampire society that Sookie and Bill's relationship introduce. While trying to prove her brother's innocence in relation to Maudette and Dawn's murders, Bill takes Sookie to the vampire bar "Fangtasia" to investigate. There, Sookie is introduced to Fangtasia's owner and the vampire sheriff of "Area 5" in Louisiana: Eric Northman (Alexander Skarsgård).[tpl]ref|Dragon House|E-4[/tpl] Eric is immediately interested in Sookie and her strange abilities, but his progeny and assistant Pam (Kristin Bauer) is less impressed.[tpl]ref|Dragon House|E-4[/tpl] Eric employs Sookie to find a thief in his bar, but the perpetrator (a vampire named Longshadow) attempts to kill Sookie when she reveals his identity. Bill stakes and kills the thief to save her, but has committed a serious crime in killing another vampire.[tpl]ref|Fourth|E-8[/tpl] When Bill is tried for his crime, his punishment is to transform seventeen-year-old Jessica Hamby (Deborah Ann Woll) into a vampire to replace the one he destroyed.[tpl]ref|Wanna Know|E-10[/tpl]
A secondary plotline introduced in the first season (which later becomes a main plotline in Season 2) is that although many humans are attracted to vampires (referred to as "fang bangers") and flock to establishments like Fangtasia, not all people are accepting of the idea that vampires should be given rights equal to those afforded the mortals of the True Blood universe. During the first season, one of the ways in which anti-vampire sentiment is expressed is through regular televised appearances by the "Fellowship of the Sun",[tpl]ref|First Taste|E-2[/tpl] a Dallas-based church that in Season 2 becomes headed by the Reverend Steve Newlin (Michael McMillian)[tpl]ref|Mine|E-3[/tpl] after his father and family are killed in a strange "accident".[tpl]ref|First Taste|E-2[/tpl]
During the second season of True Blood, the influence of Maryann Forrester and the conflict between vampires and humans is expanded. Most of the cast from the first season returns and several new main characters are introduced. The same style of interconnected story telling used in the first season is repeated, with the foremost plot focusing on Maryann Forrester being revealed as a maenad[tpl]ref|Release|E-19[/tpl] with the power to influence humans.[tpl]ref|Scratches|E-15[/tpl] She begins by manipulating Tara and Eggs to achieve her goal of summoning her god to earth,[tpl]ref|Timebomb|E-20[/tpl] and eventually takes control of almost the entire population of Bon Temps.[tpl]ref|New World|E-22[/tpl]
While Maryann begins establishing her hold on Bon Temps, Sookie is recruited by Eric[tpl]ref|Scratches|E-15[/tpl] to investigate the disappearance of his 2000-year-old maker and the Sheriff of Area 9 in Texas: Godric (Allan Hyde).[tpl]ref|Never Let|E-17[/tpl] While Sookie is absent from Bon Temps, Sam hires Daphne Landry (Ashley Jones) to join Merlotte's staff.[tpl]ref|Nothing but|E-13[/tpl] Daphne (who is revealed to also be a shapeshifter[tpl]ref|Never Let|E-17[/tpl]) begins a romance with Sam,[tpl]ref|Fingerpop|E-16[/tpl] but is later exposed as working for Maryann.[tpl]ref|Hannah|E-18[/tpl] Jason also leaves Bon Temps for Dallas to join the Fellowship of the Sun,[tpl]ref|Party Going|E-14[/tpl] which Reverend Newlin has steered in a new militant direction despite the protestations of his wife Sarah (Anna Camp).[tpl]ref|Nothing but|E-13[/tpl] Godric is discovered in the custody of the Fellowship,[tpl]ref|Never Let|E-17[/tpl] and one of Godric's lieutenants, Isabel Beaumont (Valerie Cruz),[tpl]ref|Never Let|E-17[/tpl] sends her human boyfriend Hugo (Christopher Gartin)[tpl]ref|Hannah|E-18[/tpl] to assist Sookie in infiltrating the church. Though Eric's primary interest in Dallas is finding Godric, he also attempts to place himself between Sookie and Bill. To accomplish this, he enlists the aid of Bill's maker Lorena (Mariana Klaveno);[tpl]ref|Never Let|E-17[/tpl], who thus becomes a more prominent contribution to the cast after a brief introduction in the first season.[tpl]ref|Sparks|E-5[/tpl] In the penultimate episode of the second season, once the conflict in Texas is concluded, the vampire queen of Louisiana Sophie-Anne Leclerq (Evan Rachel Wood) is introduced.[tpl]ref|Frenzy|E-23[/tpl] Both Bill and Eric visit her in an attempt to find out how to defeat Maryann.[tpl]ref|Frenzy|E-23[/tpl]. Bill uses the information provided by Sophie-Anne to devise a plan involving Sam and Sookie, and the three manage to kill Maryann in the season two finale. Subsequently, Bill takes Sookie out to an exclusive French restaurant to propose to her; but before she can give her answer, Bill is kidnapped.
Season three picks up straight after the events of season two with Sookie on the hunt to track down Bill and his kidnappers. She turns to Eric for help, who is not interested (seeing this turn of events as a chance to get Sookie for himself), but he ends up sending werewolf Alcide Herveaux (Joe Manganiello) for assistance after it is revealed that Bill was taken by V-addicted werewolves in the employ of the 3000-year-old vampire king of Mississippi, Russell Edgington (Denis O'Hare). Meanwhile, back in Bon Temps, Lafayette embarks on a relationship with his mother's care nurse and brujo Jesús Velasquez (Kevin Alejandro) and learns about his own special powers as a medium, while Sam hires a new waitress at Merlotte's, Wiccan Holly Cleary (Lauren Bowles).
Deadline reported that in season 4, Jessica Tuck (Nan Flanagan) and Janina Gavankar (Luna) will become season regulars. Alex Breckenridge (Kate) and Vedette Lim (Naomi) will be recurring actresses.[tpl]cite web|url= http://www.tvguide.com/News/True-Blood-Tuck-1026065.aspx|title= True Blood Promotes Jessica Tuck; Adds Three New Actresses|publisher=TVGuide.com|accessdate=November 29, 2010[/tpl]

==Season synopsis==

===Season one: 2008===

The main mystery of the first season concerns the murders of women connected to Sookie's brother, Jason (Ryan Kwanten). Maudette Pickens and Dawn Green are both strangled shortly after having been alone with Jason. Though Detective Bellefleur has little doubt that Jason is the killer, the town sheriff does not suspect him. Sookie's grandmother is murdered shortly afterward. At the end of the season it is revealed that Arlene Fowler's fiancé, Rene Lenier, is actually a man named Drew Marshall who has created a false identity, complete with Cajun accent. He has been killing women who have had associations with vampires.
The first season also focuses on Sookie's relationship with Bill and Sam's relationship with Sookie's friend Tara. Bill explains the rules of being a vampire to Sookie and, after killing a vampire to defend her, is forced to "turn" a young girl named Jessica into a vampire as punishment. In the last episode of the season, Jessica is left under Bill's care. After Maudette and Dawn's murders, Jason becomes addicted to vampire blood and has a short relationship with another addict, Amy Burley, which ends when she is murdered by Marshall. The season ends with the discovery of a body in Detective Andy Bellefleur's car in Merlotte's parking lot.

===Season two: 2009===

Season two focuses on two main plots – in the first, the disappearance of the 2,000-year-old vampire Sheriff of Area 9, Godric, causes Eric to enlist Sookie and Bill's aid in finding the ancient vampire in Dallas. Their paths cross Jason's as he seeks to discover meaning in his life with the Fellowship of the Sun, a church dedicated to anti-vampire activities.
The second plot line concerns a maenad named Maryann who visits Bon Temps after Tara attracts her attention at the end of the first season. Maryann is a figure from Sam's past and knows his true identity as a shapeshifter. Her influence on the town and its residents results in mayhem that grows more destructive as the season progresses. At the end of the season, Bill proposes to Sookie, but is kidnapped by unknown assailants when Sookie retreats to the bathroom to consider his proposal.
The second season loosely follows the plot of the second novel of The Southern Vampire Mysteries, Living Dead in Dallas. In addition, the character of Sophie-Anne Leclerq, initially introduced in the sixth novel Definitely Dead, was introduced as a major supporting character.

Season three loosely follows the plot of the third novel of The Southern Vampire Mysteries, Club Dead, and introduces werewolves to the show's mythology. It also introduces the characters of Russell Edgington, the Vampire King of Mississippi, and his private investigator, Franklin Mott. In addition, some characters from the fourth novel Dead to the World are introduced: Crystal Norris as Jason's love interest, her family of werepanthers from Hotshot, and Sookie's fairy godmother, Claudine. Sookie's heritage as part faerie is also revealed later in the season, a major plot element from the eighth and ninth novels From Dead to Worse and Dead and Gone. This season ends with Jason left to take care of Hotshot, Tara leaving Bon Temps, Bill fighting the queen, Sam shooting Tommy, and Hoyt and Jessica, moving in together. The final cliffhanger is Claudine taking Sookie to Faerie.

The first, titled "She's Not There",  aired Sunday, June 26, 2011 in the US on HBO; the season finale aired Sunday, September 11, 2011.[tpl]cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/06/21/true-blood-renewed-by-hbo-for-a-fourth-season/54804|title="True Blood" Renewed by HBO for a Fourth Season|work=TV by the Numbers|last=Seidman|first=Robert|date=June 21, 2010|accessdate=November 9, 2010[/tpl] It is loosely based on the fourth novel in The Southern Vampire Mysteries series, Dead to the World.[tpl]cite web|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/10/18/true-blood-season-4-eric-memory/|title='True Blood' season 4: Who, besides Kristin Bauer, wants Eric to...|work=Entertainment Weekly|last=Bierly|first=Mandi|date=October 18, 2010|accessdate=November 15, 2010[/tpl]
A coven of witches, led by Marnie, poses a threat to vampires when they discover the witches are working on necromancy. Sookie returns to Bon Temps after a year (even though she was away for only a few minutes in Fairie Land) to find Bill as the new King of Louisiana and that her brother and friends had given up on her. As the series progresses, a powerful necromancer from the 16th century, Antonia, possesses the body of Marnie in order to exact revenge on all vampires. Sookie starts a romance with Eric who has amnesia due to a spell cast by Antonia / Marnie. The witch Antonia eventually realizes the wrongdoing she's caused to innocent people and decides to stop. Yet Marnie, addicted to Antonia's power, binds her against her will to acquire her powers. Subplots include Lafayette's introduction to the world of magic and his abilities as a medium, Sam's family troubles, Alcide and Debbie's troubled relationship, and Jason, Hoyt and Jessica's love triangle. The finale is a series of cliffhangers, including a warning from the ghost of Rene that Terry will cause Arlene trouble, the escape of Russell Edgington, the reappearance of Steve Newlin as a vampire, and the shooting of Tara.

On August 11, 2011, HBO announced that True Blood would be renewed for a fifth season of 12 episodes, to premiere in summer of 2012, with a confirmed date of June 10 at 9pm.

Alan Ball signed a multi-year contract with HBO in July 2011,  but only agreed to produce the show for the fifth season.

The season follows Bill and Eric being captured by the Vampire Authority after the disappearance of Nan Flanagan. The two are almost sentenced to death by the Guardian, Roman, before revealing that Russell Edgington is alive and free after being released by a mysterious vampire. With the help of Sookie and Alcide, the team discovers his hiding place and brings him in. Season 5 also focuses on Terry, who learns he is cursed after committing a terrible crime during the war in Iraq. Meanwhile, Sookie learns that her powers are limited and contemplates having a normal life. Jason discovers his parents were murdered by a vampire and vows to find out who is responsible. Lafayette tries to deal with the powers given to him by Jesus. Russell, along with Eric's vampire sister Nora and Salome, redefine the values of the Authority and view humans as nothing more than food: just as Lilith of the Vampire bible wanted. The season ends with Bill drinking the blood of Lilith in front of Sookie and Eric. He begins to fall apart, ultimately meeting the "true death". Shortly after, a nude Bill "rises from the blood", as an even more powerful vampire reincarnation of Lilith ("Billith"). Surprised, Eric yells for Sookie to run prior to the end credits playing.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===

Critical reception of True Blood has generally been very favorable, despite the fact that initial impressions were mixed. Linda Stasi of the New York Post wrote of the opening episodes: "If HBO's new vampire show is any indication, there would still be countless deaths – especially among vampire hunters and the viewers who love them – because everyone would be dying of boredom. And so it is with HBO's new series from death-obsessed Alan Ball, creator of the legendary Six Feet Under, whose new show True Blood, won't so much make your blood run cold as it will leave you cold."
Whereas USA Today concluded: "Sexy, witty and unabashedly peculiar, True Blood is a blood-drenched Southern Gothic romantic parable set in a world where vampires are out and about and campaigning for equal rights. Part mystery, part fantasy, part comedy, and all wildly imaginative exaggeration, True Blood proves that there's still vibrant life — or death — left in the 'star-crossed cute lovers' paradigm. You just have to know where to stake your romantic claim."
By the end of the first season, True Blood had a score of 64, indicating generally favorable reviews, on Metacritic, an aggregator of critical responses.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/shows/trueblood |title=True Blood (HBO) – Reviews from Metacritic |accessdate=September 13, 2008 |publisher=MetaCritic[/tpl] The second season received a more favorable score of 74 on Metacritic.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/shows/truebloodseason2?q=True%20Blood |title=True Blood (HBO) – Reviews from Metacritic |accessdate=August 24, 2009 |publisher=MetaCritic[/tpl] The third season's rating on Metacritic has risen to 79, while the fourth season has a rating of 74.[tpl]cite web|title=True Blood Season – 3 Reviews, Ratings, Credits and More|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/true-blood/season-3|accessdate=June 13, 2012|publisher=MetaCritic[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=True Blood Season – 4 Reviews, Ratings, Credits and More|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/true-blood/season-4|accessdate=June 13, 2012|publisher=MetaCritic[/tpl] The fifth season has a rating of 73.[tpl]cite web|title=True Blood Season – 5 Reviews, Ratings, Credits and More|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/true-blood/season-5|accessdate=June 10, 2012|publisher=MetaCritic[/tpl] The sixth season has a rating of 56.

===Cultural influence===

True Blood was the subject of a 2010 Sesame Street sketch entitled "True Mud". The parody features puppet versions of Sookie, Bill, Lafayette, Sam, Tara and Sheriff Dearborn. In the skit, Muppet Sookie struggles to fulfill Muppet Bill's pleas for a pint of "True Mud", as the other characters speculate if he is a "grouch".[ref]CBC News, September 27, 2010 "CBC.ca"

In August 2010, Anna Paquin (Sookie), Stephen Moyer (Bill), and Alexander Skarsgård (Eric) appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone covered in blood and completely naked.  This cover drew criticism [tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aoltv.com/2010/08/18/true-blood-stars-naked-on-the-cover-of-rolling-stone/ |title='True Blood' Rolling Stone Cover: Bloody Hot or Too Gruesome? |publisher=Aoltv.com |date= |accessdate=November 3, 2011[/tpl] due to the image's supposed promotion of sexuality and violence. The show’s creator, Alan Ball, stated in the magazine, "To me, vampires are sex... I don't get a vampire story about abstinence. I'm 53. I don't care about high school students. I find them irritating and uninformed."

===Allegory of LGBT rights===

The struggle for vampire equality in True Blood has been interpreted as an allegory for the LGBT rights movement.[tpl]cite news|author=Ken Tucker |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20284276,00.html |title=True Blood Reviewed|publisher=Entertainment Weekly.com|date=June 10, 2009 |accessdate=June 5, 2012[/tpl] Charlaine Harris, the author of the book series on which the show is based, stated that her initial characterization for the vampires were as "...a minority that was trying to get equal rights"."Flesh & 'Blood': How HBO series has turned hot vampires into gay rights analogy", New York Post, June 23, 2009. Retrieved on 2009-06-30."'True Blood,' Tasty New TV From Alan Ball And HBO", National Public Radio, May 4, 2009. Retrieved on 2010-05-05. Several phrases in the series are borrowed and adapted from expressions used against and about LGBT people, such as "God Hates Fangs" (God Hates Fags) and "Coming out of the coffin" (coming out of the closet).
Entertainment Weekly[tpl]'[/tpl]s Ken Tucker wrote that the show is built "around a series of metaphors: Vampire rights stand in for gay rights, and now the clever laughs elicited from this bratty-vampire girl represent an extreme of adolescent rebelliousness". David Bianculli of NPR wrote, "True Blood is big on allegory, and the tension about accepting vampires into society is an obvious play on civil rights in general, and gay rights in particular". However, the series' creator, Alan Ball, who is gay, has stated that such a comparison is lazy and possibly homophobic; and Lauren Gutterman of the Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies has expressed concerns that the show might perpetuate negative stereotypes of homosexuals as deviants.
