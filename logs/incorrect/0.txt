The Washington Post (WP) is an American daily newspaper. It is the most widely circulated newspaper published in Washington, D.C., and was founded in 1877, making it the area's oldest extant newspaper.
Located in the capital city of the United States, the newspaper has a particular emphasis on national politics. Daily editions are printed for the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia. The newspaper is published as a broadsheet, with photographs printed both in color and in black and white. In 2008, Marcus Brauchli replaced long-time executive editor Leonard Downie, Jr., serving publisher Katharine Weymouth.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/business/media/the-washington-post-recast-for-a-digital-future.html?ref=technology&pagewanted=all |title=A Newspaper, and a Legacy, Reordered |last=Peters |first=Jeremy |work = The New York Times |date=February 11, 2012 |accessdate=February 13, 2012[/tpl] In November 2012, Weymouth announced that Boston Globe editor Martin Baron would take over Brauchli's position on January 2, 2013.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/marcus-brauchli-to-step-down-as-editor-of-the-washington-post/2012/11/13/952698e0-2daf-11e2-a99d-5c4203af7b7a_story.html |title=Marcus Brauchli to Step Down As Editor of The Washington Post |last=Farhi |first=Paul |publisher=The Washington Post |date=November 13, 2012[/tpl][tpl]cite news |url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/13/new-top-editor-at-washington-post-brauchli-to-be-replaced-by-marty-baron |title=New Top Editor at Washington Post: Marcus Brauchli to Be Replaced by Martin Baron |last=Haughney |first=Christine |date=November 13, 2012 |work=The New York Times[/tpl][tpl]Dead link |date=August 2013[/tpl]
In the early 1970s, in the best known episode in the recent history of The Post, reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein led the American press's investigation into what became known as the Watergate scandal; reporting in the newspaper greatly contributed to the resignation of President Richard Nixon.

==Overview==

The Post is generally regarded as one of the leading daily American newspapers,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.mondotimes.com/1/world/us/51/474/6821 |title=Washington Post - Daily Newspaper in Washington DC, USA with Local News and Events |publisher=Mondo Code LLC |date= |accessdate= March 31, 2012[/tpl] along with The New York Times, and The Wall Street Journal. The Post has distinguished itself through its political reporting on the workings of the White House, Congress, and other aspects of the U.S. government.
Unlike the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post does not print an edition for distribution away from the East Coast.  In 2009, the newspaper ceased publication of its National Weekly Edition, which combined stories from the week's print editions, due to shrinking circulation.[tpl]cite news | title= Post's National Weekly Edition to Close | url= http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ombudsman-blog/2009/08/posts_national_weekly_edition.html | work= The Washington Post | accessdate= June 2, 2011[/tpl] The majority of its newsprint readership is in District of Columbia and its suburbs in Maryland and Northern Virginia.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpostads.com/adsite/why/media/reach/page1450.html|work=Washington Post Media|title=The Washington Post's Circulation and Reach|accessdate= March 2, 2009[/tpl]

Sunday editions largely include the weekday sections as well as Outlook (opinion), Arts, Travel, Comics, TV Week, and the Washington Post Magazine. The Sunday Style section differs slightly from the weekday Style section; it is in a tabloid format, and it houses the reader-written humor contest The Style Invitational.
Additional weekly sections appear on weekdays: Health & Science on Tuesday, Food on Wednesday, Local Living (home and garden) on Thursday, and Weekend, with details about upcoming events in the local area, on Friday. The latter two are in a tabloid format.
The newspaper is one of a few U.S. newspapers with foreign bureaus, located in Baghdad, Bogota, Cairo, Hong Kong, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Shanghai, Tehran and Tokyo.[tpl]cite news| url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/world/foreignbureaus/index.html | title= Washington Post Foreign Bureaus | work=The Washington Post| accessdate= June 2, 2011[/tpl] In November 2009, it announced the closure of its U.S. regional bureaus[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] Chicago, Los Angeles and New York[tpl]spaced ndash[/tpl] as part of an increased focus on "...political stories and local news coverage in Washington."[tpl]cite news| title= Washington Post to close three regional bureaux | publisher= BBC News | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8377802.stm | date= November 25, 2009 | accessdate= November 25, 2009[/tpl] The newspaper has local bureaus in Maryland (Annapolis, Montgomery County, Prince George's County, Southern Maryland) and Virginia (Alexandria, Fairfax, Loudoun County, Richmond, and Prince William County).[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.washpost.com/news_ed/news/bureaus.shtml| title= Washington Post Bureaus | work=The Washington Post| accessdate= November 25, 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=December 2010[/tpl]

==History==

===Founding and early period===

The newspaper was founded in 1877 by Stilson Hutchins (1838–1912) and in 1880 added a Sunday edition, thus becoming the city's first newspaper to publish seven days a week. In 1889, Hutchins sold the newspaper to Frank Hatton, a former Postmaster General, and Beriah Wilkins, a former Democratic congressman from Ohio. To promote the newspaper, the new owners requested the leader of the Marine Band, John Philip Sousa, to compose a march for the newspaper's essay contest awards ceremony. Sousa composed The Washington Post, which remains one of his best-known works. In 1899, during the Spanish–American War, The Post printed Clifford K. Berryman's classic illustration Remember the Maine, which became the battle-cry for American sailors during the War. In 1902, Berryman published another famous cartoon in The Post— Drawing the Line in Mississippi. This cartoon depicts President Theodore Roosevelt showing compassion for a small bear cub and inspired New York store owner Morris Michtom to create the teddy bear."Clifford K. Berryman Cartoon Collection". Special Collections Research Center, Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library, George Washington University.
Wilkins acquired Hatton's share of the newspaper in 1894 at Hatton's death. After Wilkins' death in 1903, his sons John and Robert ran The Post for two years before selling it in 1905 to John Roll McLean, owner of the Cincinnati Enquirer. During the Wilson presidency, The Post was credited with the "most famous newspaper typo" in D.C. history according to Reason magazine; The Post intended to report that President Wilson had been "entertaining" his future-wife Mrs. Galt, but instead wrote that he had been "entering" Mrs. Galt.[tpl]cite news|last=Rabbe|first=Will|title=The Washington Post’s Famous 1915 Typo|url=http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/08/06/washington-post-famous-wilson-typo/|newspaper=MSNBC|date=08/06/2013[/tpl] When John McLean died in 1916, he put the newspaper in trust, having little faith that his playboy son Edward "Ned" McLean could manage his inheritance. Ned went to court and broke the trust, but, under his management, the newspaper slumped toward ruin.

===Meyer-Graham period===

The newspaper was purchased in a bankruptcy auction in 1933 by the former Chairman of the Federal Reserve's board of governors, Eugene Meyer, who restored the newspaper's health and reputation. In 1946, Meyer was succeeded as publisher by his son-in-law, Philip Graham.
In 1954, the newspaper consolidated its position by acquiring and merging with its last morning rival, the Washington Times-Herald. (The combined paper was officially named The Washington Post and Times-Herald until 1973, although the Times-Herald portion of the masthead became less and less prominent after the 1950s.) The merger left The Post with two remaining local competitors, the afternoon Washington Star (Evening Star) and The Washington Daily News, which merged in 1972 and folded in 1981. The Washington Times, established in 1982 by a subsidiary of the Unification Church, led by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon (1920-2012), has been a local conservative rival with a circulation ([tpl]As of|2005|lc=on[/tpl]) about one-seventh that of The Post.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.washtimes.com/business/20050518-120247-7729r.htm |title=Times Circulation Climbs To Buck Trend |work= The Washington Times |date= |accessdate= April 4, 2009[/tpl]  In the late 2000s additional editorially conservative competition increased with the foundation of the tabloid "The Examiner" of Washington by the new owners of the old Hearst paper, the "San Francisco Examiner" who engineered a swap trading the larger, more prosperous "San Francisco Chronicle" for the former Hearst "flagship" paper. They also started several other tabloid "Examiners" in several American cities, including briefly for two years in "Baltimore Examiner" going against the 170-year old "Baltimore Sun".  
After Phil Graham's death in 1963, control of The Washington Post Company passed to Katharine Graham (1917-2001), his wife and Meyer's daughter. Few women had run nationally prominent newspapers in the United States. Katharine Graham described her own anxiety and lack of confidence based on her gender in her autobiography. She served as publisher from 1969 to 1979 and headed The Washington Post Company into the early 1990s as chairman of the board and CEO. After 1993, she retained a position as chairman of the executive committee until her death in 2001.
Her tenure is credited with seeing the newspaper rise in national stature through effective investigative reporting, most notably to ensure that The New York Times did not surpass its Washington reporting of the Pentagon Papers and Watergate scandal. Executive editor Ben Bradlee put the newspaper's reputation and resources behind reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, who, in a long series of articles, chipped away at the story behind the 1972 burglary of Democratic National Committee offices in the Watergate Hotel complex in Washington. The Post[tpl]'s[/tpl] dogged coverage of the story, the outcome of which ultimately played a major role in the resignation of President Richard Nixon, won the newspaper a Pulitzer Prize in 1973.
In 1972, the "Book World" section was introduced with Pulitzer Prize winning critic William McPherson as its first editor.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/25thann/aranaward.htm |title=Views From Publisher's Row |first=Marie |last=Arana-Ward (then-deputy editor of "Book World") |authorlink=Marie Arana |date= June 1, 1997 |work=The Washington Post[/tpl] It featured Pulitzer Prize winning critics such as Jonathan Yardley and Michael Dirda, the latter of whom established his career as a critic at The Post. In 2009, after 37 years, with great reader outcries and protest, "The Washington Post Book World" as a standalone insert was discontinued, the last issue being Sunday, February 15, 2009, along with a general reorganization of the paper, such as placing the Sunday editorials on the back page of the main front section rather than the "Outlook" section and distributing some other locally-oriented "op-ed" letters and commentaries in other sections.Letter from the editor, The Washington Post, Sunday, February 15, 2009; Page BW02 However, book reviews are still published in the Outlook section on Sundays and in the Style section the rest of the week, as well as online.
In 1980, the newspaper published a dramatic story called "Jimmy's World",[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uncp.edu/home/canada/work/markport/lit/litjour/spg2002/cooke.htm |title=Jimmy's World |author=Cooke, Janet |authorlink=Janet Cooke |publisher= University of North Carolina at Pembroke|date= September 28, 1980 |accessdate= April 4, 2009[/tpl] describing the life of an eight-year-old heroin addict in Washington, for which reporter Janet Cooke won acclaim and a Pulitzer Prize. Subsequent investigation, however, revealed the story to be a fabrication. The Pulitzer Prize was returned.
Donald E. Graham, Katharine's son, succeeded her as publisher in 1979 and in the early 1990s became both chief executive officer and chairman of the board. He was succeeded in 2000 as publisher and CEO by Boisfeuillet Jones, Jr., with Graham remaining as chairman.
Katharine Graham Weymouth now serves as publisher and chief executive officer.

===Post-Graham period===

In 1996, the newspaper established a website.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/07/AR2008070701835.html |title=The Post's New Executive Editor Once Headed Wall Street Journal |last=Kurtz|first= Howard |authorlink=Howard Kurtz |date= July 7, 2008|work=The Washington Post|accessdate= July 7, 2008[/tpl]
In 2010, the newspaper cited its local focus as a reason for running its first-ever front page advertisement: the Capital One ad was being run to draw attention to the rebranding of Chevy Chase Bank, a bank Capital One bought in 2009. According to the Post's vice president of advertising, the page one advertisement is a "...very local, useful-information-for-our-readers type of campaign."[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/Headlines/washington-post-front-page-ad-a-first-for-now-62608-.aspx |title=Washington Post Front-Page Ad: A First, For Now |date= September 14, 2010 |publisher=Editor & Publisher[/tpl]

===Sale to Jeff Bezos===

Jeff Bezos purchased the newspaper for $250 million in cash, completing the transaction on October 1, 2013, after announcing the planned acquisition on August 5, 2013. The newspaper is currently owned by Nash Holdings LLC, a holding company created for the acquisition and controlled by Bezos. The sale included El Tiempo Latino (a Spanish language newspaper), the Fairfax Times, the Maryland Gazette, the Post Express free daily newspaper, Southern Maryland Newspapers, and several newspapers covering and for the U.S. armed forces.[tpl]cite news | url=http://www.gazette.net/article/20131001/NEWS/131009761/1033/bezos-completes-purchase-of-gazettes-post&template=gazette | first=Kevin James | last=Shay | title=Bezos completes purchase of Gazettes, Post | work=The Maryland Gazette | date=October 1, 2013 | accessdate=March 13, 2014[/tpl] Nash Holdings also took owneship of the Post printing plants in Springfield, Virginia; Fairfax County, Virginia; and Laurel, Maryland (the "Comprint plant"). Other assets included in the sale were the publications Apartment Showcase, Capital Business, Fashion Washington, Guide to Retirement Living Sourcebook, New Condominium Guide, and New Homes Guide; the internet sites TheCapitolDeal.com and ServiceAlley.com; and Comprint Military Publications (which included eight weekly newspapers covering local military bases, 10 annual guides to local military bases, and the Web sites DCMilitary.com, DCMilitaryEd.com, DCMilitaryFamLife.com).[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/104889/000095015713000294/ex2-1.htm | title=Form 8-K.

Not included the sale were other Washington Post Company assets, including the Washington Post Company's downtown office building, the Post's Robinson Terminal facilities in Alexandria, Virginia; Post-Newsweek Stations; Cable ONE (a Phoenix, Arizona-based Internet and cable service provider); independent web-based media assets such as Slate Group (Slate magazine and its sister video magazine, Slate V), The Root, and Foreign Policy; social media marketing company Social Code; home healthcare and hospice provider Celtic Healthcare; and the energy parts supplier Forney Corporation. After the completion of the sale, a press release announced the name change of the Washington Post Company to Graham Holdings Company (the change was made effective on November 29, 2013).[tpl]cite news|title=Washington Post Co. renamed Graham Holdings Company to mark sale of newspaper|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/washington-post-co-renamed-graham-holdings-company-to-mark-sale-of-newspaper/2013/11/18/57fbc7fe-5060-11e3-9e2c-e1d01116fd98_story.html|accessdate=3 January 2014|newspaper=Washington Post|date=18 November 2013|author=Debbi Wilgoren[/tpl] 
In early September 2013, Bezos summarized his approach for the news organization—with a vision that recreates "the 'daily ritual' of reading The Post as a bundle, not merely a series of individual stories"—although he indicated that the experience was more likely to be created on tablet computers and less likely "on the Web."[tpl]cite news |last=Farhi |first=Paul |first2=Craig |last2=Timberg |title=Jeff Bezos to His Future Washington Post Journalists: Put the Readers First |url=http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-09-04/lifestyle/41765347_1_jeff-bezos-tablet-computers-readers |accessdate=2013-09-04 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=2013-09-28 [/tpl]

==Political stance==

In the mid-1970s, conservatives called the newspaper "Pravda on the Potomac" because of its perceived left-wing bias in both reporting and editorials.Bartlett, Bruce (March 13, 2007). "Partisan Press Parity?". The Washington Times. Since then, the appellation has been used by both liberal and conservative critics of the newspaper.Kirchick, James (February 18, 2009).  "Pravda on the Potomac". The New Republic.William Greider, "Washington Post Warriors", The Nation, March 6, 2003. In 1963, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover reportedly told President Lyndon B.

As Katharine Graham noted in her autobiography Personal History, the newspaper long had a policy of not making endorsements for political candidates. However, since at least 2000, the newspaper has occasionally endorsed Republican politicians, such as Maryland Governor Robert Ehrlich.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/25/AR2006102501668.html |title=Wrong Choice for Governor |work=The Washington Post |date= October 26, 2006|accessdate= April 4, 2009[/tpl] In 2006, it repeated its historic endorsements of every Republican incumbent for Congress in Northern Virginia.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/29/AR2006102900552.html |title=For Congress in Virginia |work=The Washington Post |date= October 30, 2006|accessdate= April 4, 2009[/tpl] There have also been times when The Post has specifically chosen not to endorse any candidate, such as in the 1988 presidential election when it refused to endorse then-Governor Michael Dukakis or then-Vice President George H.W. Bush. On October 17, 2008, The Post endorsed Barack Obama for President of the United States.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/16/AR2008101603436.html |title=Barack Obama for President |work=The Washington Post |date= October 17, 2008|accessdate= April 4, 2009[/tpl] On October 25, 2012, the newspaper endorsed the re-election of Barack Obama.[tpl]cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/washington-post-endorsement-four-more-years-for-president-obama/2012/10/25/6ca309a2-1965-11e2-bd10-5ff056538b7c_story.html |title=Washington Post Endorsement: Four More Years for President Obama |work=The Washington Post |date= October 25, 2012|accessdate= October 28, 2012 |first=Editorial |last=Board[/tpl]
In "Buying the War" on PBS, Bill Moyers noted 27 editorials supporting George W. Bush's ambitions to invade Iraq. National security correspondent Walter Pincus reported that he had been ordered to cease his reports that were critical of Republican administrations.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/btw/transcript1.html |title=Transcript: "Buying the War"|work=PBS |date= April 25, 2007 |accessdate= December 13, 2009[/tpl]
In 1992, the PBS investigative news program Frontline suggested that The Post had moved to the right in response to its smaller, more conservative rival The Washington Times, which is owned by News World Communications, an international media conglomerate owned by the Unification Church, which also owns newspapers in South Korea, Japan, and South America. The program quoted Paul Weyrich, one of the founders of the conservative activist organization the Moral Majority, as saying "The Washington Post became very arrogant and they just decided that they would determine what was news and what wasn't news and they wouldn't cover a lot of things that went on. And The Washington Times has forced The Post to cover a lot of things that they wouldn't cover if the Times wasn't in existence."[tpl]citation needed|date=August 2013[/tpl] In 2008, Thomas F. Roeser of the Chicago Daily Observer also mentioned competition from the Washington Times as a factor moving The Post to the right.Roeser, Thomas F. (August 18, 2008).

On March 26, 2007, Chris Matthews said on his television program, "Well, The Washington Post is not the liberal newspaper it was, Congressman, let me tell you.

In November 2007, the newspaper was criticized by independent journalist Robert Parry for reporting on anti-Obama chain e-mails without sufficiently emphasizing to its readers the false nature of the anonymous claims.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.consortiumnews.com/2007/112907.html |title=WPost Buys into Anti-Obama Bigotry |author=Robert Parry |authorlink=Robert Parry (journalist) |work=Consortium News |date= November 29, 2007 |accessdate= April 4, 2009[/tpl] In 2009, Parry criticized the newspaper for its allegedly unfair reporting on liberal politicians, including Vice President Al Gore and President Barack Obama."Framing Obama – by the WPost".

In a November 16, 2008, column, The Washington Post ombudsman Deborah Howell stated: "I'll bet that most Post journalists voted for Obama. I did. There are centrists at The Post as well.

Yet opinion was still weighted toward Obama. It's not hard to see why conservatives feel disrespected".  According to a 2009 publication, in the blogging community, liberal bloggers link to the Washington Post and New York Times more often than other major newspapers; however, conservative bloggers also link predominantly to liberal newspapers.[tpl]cite book|author=Richard Davis|title=Typing Politics: The Role of Blogs in American Politics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PWZ2-5wla3MC&pg=PA79|year=2009|publisher=Oxford UP|page=79[/tpl]

 GUESS TEXT:

CATEGORIES: American media

Media of the United States consist of several different types of communications media: television, radio, cinema, newspapers, magazines, and Internet-based Web sites. The U.S. also has a strong music industry.
Many of the media are controlled by large for-profit corporations who reap revenue from advertising, subscriptions, and sale of copyrighted material.
American media conglomerates tend to be leading global players, generating large revenues as well as large opposition in many parts of the world. With the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, further deregulation and convergence are under way, leading to mega-mergers, further concentration of media ownership, and the emergence of multinational media conglomerates. These mergers enable tighter control of information.Zinn, Howard. A People's History of the United States. New York: Harper Perennial Modern Classics, 2005. p. 671 ISBN 0060838655 Currently, six corporations control roughly 90% of the media.These 6 Corporations Control 90% Of The Media In America.

Theories to explain the success of such companies include reliance on certain policies of the American federal government or a tendency to natural monopolies in the industry. See Media bias in the United States.
The organisation Reporters Without Borders compiles and publishes an annual ranking of countries based upon the organisation's assessment of their press freedom records. In 2013-14 United States was ranked 46th out of 180 countries, a drop of thirteen points from the preceding year.[tpl]Cite web|url=http://rsf.org/index2014/en-index2014.php |title=World Press Freedom Index 2014 |publisher=Reporters Without Borders |accessdate=14 February 2014[/tpl]Stearns, Josh (11 February 2014).

==Radio==

American radio broadcasts in two bands: FM and AM. Some stations are only talk radio – featuring interviews and discussions – while music radio stations broadcast one particular type of music: Top 40, hip-hop, country, etc. Radio broadcast companies have become increasingly consolidated in recent years. National Public Radio is the nation's primary public radio network, but most radio stations are commercial and profit-oriented.
Talk radio as a political medium has also exploded in popularity during the 1990s, due to the 1987 repeal of the Fairness Doctrine, which meant that stations no longer had to "balance" their day by programming alternative points of view.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC)in 1970 had limited the number of radio station one person or company could own to 1 am and 1 FM locally and 7 am and 7 FM stations nationally. See IBOC and HD Radio.
A new form of radio that is gaining popularity is satellite radio. The two biggest subscriptions based radio services are Sirius Satellite Radio and XM Satellite Radio, which have recently merged to form Sirius XM Radio. Unlike terrestrial radio music channels are commercial free and other channels feature minimal commercials. Satellite radio also is not regulated by the FCC.
Arbitron, a consumer research company, provides ratings (similar to the Nielsen ratings) for national and local radio stations in the United States.

==Television==

Ninety-nine percent of American households have at least one television and the majority of households have more than one. The four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) and Fox.
Public television has a far smaller role than in most other countries. However, a number of states, including West Virginia, Maryland, Kentucky, and South Carolina, among others, do have state-owned public broadcasting authorities which operate and fund all public television stations in their respective states. The income received from the government is insufficient to cover expenses and stations also rely on corporate sponsorships and viewer contributions.
DirecTV and Dish Network are the major satellite television providers, with 20 and 14 million customers respectively as of February 2014.Consumers wary of Comcast, Time Warner Cable merger - USA Today, 13 February 2014 Meanwhile, the major cable television providers are Comcast with 22 million customers, Time Warner Cable with 11 million, and Cox Communications, Charter Communications, AT&T U-Verse and Verizon FiOS with 5-6 million each.

==Motion pictures==

In the 20th century, the motion picture industry rose to become one of the most successful and powerful industries in the U.S. Along with other intellectual property industries, its relative importance to the American economy has strengthened as the importance of manufacturing and agriculture have decreased (due to globalization[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]).

==Newspapers==

Newspapers have declined in their influence and penetration into American households over the years. The U.S. does not have a national paper. The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal are sold in most U.S. cities.[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2008[/tpl]
Although the Times' primary audience has always been the people of New York City, the New York Times has gradually become the dominant national "newspaper of record." Apart from its daily nationwide distribution, the term means that back issues are archived on microfilm by every decent-sized public library in the nation, and the Times' articles are often cited by both historians and judges as evidence that a major historical event occurred on a certain date. The Los Angeles Times and the Wall Street Journal are also newspapers of record to a lesser extent. Although USA Today has tried to establish itself as a national paper, it has been widely derided by the academic world as the "McPaper" and is not subscribed to (let alone archived) by most libraries.
Apart from the newspapers just mentioned, all major metropolitan areas have their own local newspapers. Typically, a metropolitan area will support at most one or two major newspapers, with many smaller publications targeted towards particular audiences. Although the cost of publishing has increased over the years, the price of newspapers has generally remained low, forcing newspapers to rely more on advertising revenue and on articles provided by a major wire service, such as the Associated Press or Reuters, for their national and world coverage.
With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families.
Most general-purpose newspapers are either being printed one time a week, usually on Thursday or Friday, or are printed daily. Weekly newspapers tend to have much smaller circulation and are more prevalent in rural communities or small towns. Major cities often have "alternative weeklies" to complement the mainstream daily paper(s), for example, New York City's Village Voice or Los Angeles' L.A. Weekly, to name two of the best-known. Major cities may also support a local business journal, trade papers relating to local industries, and papers for local ethnic and social groups.
Probably due to competition from other media, the number of daily newspapers in the U.S. has declined over the past half-century, according to Editor & Publisher, the trade journal of American newspapers. In particular, the number of evening newspapers has fallen by almost one-half since 1970, while the number of morning editions and Sunday editions has grown.
For comparison, in 1950, there were 1,772 daily papers (and 1,450 – or about 70 percent – of them were evening papers) while in 2000, there were 1,480 daily papers (and 766—or about half—of them were evening papers.)
Daily newspaper circulation is also slowly declining in America, partly due to the near-demise of two-newspaper towns, as the weaker newspapers in most cities have folded:
 
 
The primary source of newspaper income is advertising – in the form of "classifieds" or inserted advertising circulars – rather than circulation income. However, since the late 1990s, this revenue source has been directly challenged by Web sites like eBay (for sales of secondhand items), Monster.com (jobs), and Craigslist (everything).
Additionally, as investigative journalism declined at major daily newspapers in the 2000s, many reporters formed their own non-profit investigative newsrooms. Examples include ProPublica on the national level, Texas Tribune at the state level and Voice of OC at the local level.
The largest newspapers (by circulation) in the United States are USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times.

==Magazines==

Thanks to the huge size of the English-speaking North American media market, the United States has a large magazine industry with hundreds of magazines serving almost every interest, as can be determined by glancing at any newsstand in any large American city. Most magazines are owned by one of the large media conglomerates or by one of their smaller regional brethren.
The U.S. has three leading weekly newsmagazines: Time, Newsweek and U.S. News and World Report. Time and Newsweek are center-left while U.S. News and World Report tends to be center-right. Time is well known for naming a "Person of the Year" each year, while U.S. News publishes annual ratings of American colleges and universities.
The U.S. also has over a dozen major political magazines.
Finally, besides the hundreds of specialized magazines that serve the diverse interests and hobbies of the American people, there are also dozens of magazines published by professional organizations for their members, such as Communications of the ACM (for computer science specialists) and the ABA Journal (for lawyers).

==Internet==

The Internet has provided a means for newspapers and other media organizations to deliver news and, significantly, the means to look up old news. Some organizations only make limited amounts of their output available for free, and charge for access to the rest. Other organizations allow their archives to be freely browsed. It is possible that the latter type obtain more influence, as they are true to the spirit of freedom of information by virtue of making it free. Anyone who has followed external links only to be confronted with a pay to view banner, might attest that the reputations of organizations that charge is not enhanced by their charging policy, particularly when the same information is available from sources that don't charge.
The Internet, by means of making available such constantly growing news archives, is, in effect, writing our history as it happens, at a level of detail never before known. While proprietary archives are slowly exposed to the public after many decades, organizations that maintain immediately updating resources have more control over what will be remembered by the general public in the near future.
