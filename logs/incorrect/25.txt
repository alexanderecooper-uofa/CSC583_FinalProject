Casablanca (Moroccan Arabic pronunciation: [tpl]IPA-ar|kɑzɑblɑnkɑ|[/tpl], also [tpl]lang|ary|الدار البيضاء[/tpl] [tpl]transl|ary|ed-Dar el-Biḍa [/tpl] lit: "White house"), the largest city of Morocco, is located in the western part of the country on the Atlantic Ocean. It is also the largest city in the Maghreb, as well as one of the largest and most important cities in Africa, both economically and demographically.
Casablanca is Morocco's chief port and industrial center. The 2012 census, adjusted with recent numbers, recorded a population of about 4 million in the prefecture of Casablanca and about 5 million in the region of Grand Casablanca. Casablanca is considered the economic and business center of Morocco, while the national political capital is Rabat.
The leading Moroccan companies and international corporations doing business there have their headquarters and main industrial facilities in Casablanca. Recent industrial statistics show Casablanca retains its historical position as the main industrial zone of the country. The Port of Casablanca is one of the largest artificial ports in the world,[tpl]cite web|url=http://lexicorient.com/e.o/casablan.htm |title=Casablanca – Encyclopedia of the Orient |publisher=Lexicorient.com |date= |accessdate=28 August 2010[/tpl] and the largest port of North Africa.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.africa-ata.org/mc_casablanca.htm |title=Discovering Casablanca |publisher=Africa-ata.org |date= |accessdate=17 April 2011[/tpl] It is also the primary naval base for the Royal Moroccan Navy.

==Etymology==

The Latinized name of the city is a Portuguese word combination meaning "White house" ([tpl]lang|pt|branca[/tpl] "white", [tpl]lang|pt|casa[/tpl] "house"). The modern Spanish version of the name came later. The city is now nicknamed Casa by many locals.
Anfa is generally considered the "original city" or "old city" of Casablanca; it is legally a prefecture (district) with half a million city inhabitants, and thus is part of the Grand Casablanca region.

==History==

===Early history===

The area which is today Casablanca was founded and settled by Berbers by at least the 7th century BC.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Casablanca.html |title=Casablanca |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=17 April 2011[/tpl] It was used as a port by the Phoenicians and later the Romans.[tpl]cite web|author=Tore Kjeilen |url=http://www.lexicorient.com/e.o/casablanca.htm |title=Casablanca – LookLex Encyclopaedia |publisher=Lexicorient.com |date= |accessdate=17 April 2011[/tpl] In his book Wasf Afriquia, Al-Hassan al-Wazzan refers to ancient Casablanca as "Anfa", a great city founded in the Berber kingdom of Barghawata in 744 AD. He believed Casablanca was the most "prosperous city on the Atlantic coast because of its fertile land."[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.kennesaw.edu/historymuseum/creatingcommunity.shtml |title=Museum of History & Holocaust Education: Creating Community Collaboration |publisher=Kennesaw.edu |date= |accessdate=17 April 2011[/tpl] Barghawata rose as an independent state around this time, and continued until it was conquered by the Almoravids in 1068.

===Middle Ages to French conquest===

During the 14th century, under the Merinids, Anfa rose in importance as a port. The last of the Merinids was ousted by a popular revolt in 1465.[tpl]cite book|last1=Vauchez|first1=André|last2=Dobson|first2=Richard Barrie|last3=Lapidge|first3=Michael|title=Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=om4olQhrE84C&pg=PA941|accessdate=22 April 2012|year=2000|publisher=Editions du Cerf|isbn=978-1-57958-282-1|page=941[/tpl] In the early 15th century, the town became an independent state once again, and emerged as a safe harbour for pirates and privateers, leading to it being targeted by the Portuguese, who destroyed the town in 1468.[tpl]cite book|title=Guide to places of the world|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kQ9dAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=22 April 2012|date=April 1987|publisher=Reader's Digest Association|page=133[/tpl] The Portuguese used the ruins of Anfa to build a military fortress in 1515. The town that grew up around it was called "Casa Branca", meaning "white house" in Portuguese.
Between 1580 and 1640 the Crown of Portugal and the Crown of Spain were held by the same kings and therefore Casablanca and all other areas occupied by the Portuguese were under Spanish control, even though maintaining an autonomous Portuguese administration. As Portugal broke ties with the Spanish king in 1640, Casablanca came under fully Portuguese control once again.[tpl]cite book|author=The International City of Tangier, Second Edition|title=The International City of Tangier, Second Edition|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VGqmAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA5|accessdate=22 April 2012|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-4351-8|page=5[/tpl] The Europeans eventually abandoned the area completely in 1755 following an earthquake which destroyed most of the town.[tpl]cite book|last=Aldosari|first=Ali|title=Middle East, western Asia, and northern Africa|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=j894miuOqc4C&pg=PA1254|accessdate=22 April 2012|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-7571-2|page=1254[/tpl]
The town was finally reconstructed by Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah (1756–1790), the grandson of Moulay Ismail and ally of George Washington with the help of Spaniards from the nearby emporium. The town was called الدار البيضاء ad-Dār al-Bayḍāʼ, the Arabic translation of the Spanish Casa Blanca, meaning "white house".
In the 19th century, the area's population began to grow as it became a major supplier of wool to the booming textile industry in Britain and shipping traffic increased (the British, in return, began importing Morocco's now famous national drink, gunpowder tea).[tpl]cite book|last=Srhir|first=Khalid Ben|title=Britain And Morocco During The Embassy Of John Drummond Hay, 1845–1886|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3Wf_Av7-hIoC&pg=PA126|accessdate=22 April 2012|date=19 April 2005|publisher=RoutledgeCurzon|isbn=978-0-7146-5432-4|page=126[/tpl] By the 1860s, there were around 5,000 residents, and the population grew to around 10,000 by the late 1880s.Pennel, CR: Morocco from Empire to Independence, Oneworld, Oxford, 2003, p 121 Casablanca remained a modestly sized port, with a population reaching around 12,000 within a few years of the French conquest and arrival of French colonialists in the town, at first administrators within a sovereign sultanate, in 1906. By 1921, this was to rise to 110,000,Pennel, CR: Morocco from Empire to Independence, Oneworld, Oxford, 2003, p 149. largely through the development of shanty towns.

===French rule===

In June 1907, the French attempted to build a light railway near the port and passing through a graveyard. Residents attacked the French, and riots ensued. French troops were landed in order to restore order, which was achieved only after severe damage to the town. The French then took control of Casablanca. This effectively began the process of colonization, although French control of Casablanca was not formalised until 1910.
The famous 1942 film Casablanca underlined the city's colonial status at the time—depicting it as the scene of a power struggle between competing European powers. The film has a cosmopolitan cast of characters (American, French, German, Italian, Czech, Norwegian, Austrian, Bulgarian, Russian and some other nationalities).
Europeans formed almost half the population.Albert Habib Hourani, Malise Ruthven (2002). "A history of the Arab peoples". Harvard University Press. p.323. ISBN 0-674-01017-5 During the 1940s and 1950s, Casablanca was a major centre of anti-French rioting.

===World War II===

Operation Torch (initially called Operation Gymnast) was the British-American invasion of French North Africa during the North African Campaign of World War II, which started on 8 November 1942.
The Americans attacked at three different locations in French North Africa, one of the three being the landings at Casablanca because of its important ports and the major administrative centers.[tpl]cite book|last=Alexander|first=Bevin|title=How Hitler Could Have Won World War II|year=2000|publisher=Three Rivers Press|pages=167, 169[/tpl]
Casablanca was an important strategic port during World War II and hosted the Casablanca Conference in 1943, in which Churchill and Roosevelt discussed the progress of the war.

===Neighborhoods===

The list of neighborhoods is indicative and not complete:

The population of the city is about 11% of the total population of Morocco. Grand Casablanca is also the largest urban area in the Maghreb. The number of inhabitants is however disputed by the locals, who point to a number between 5 and 6 million[tpl]Citation needed|date=December 2009[/tpl], citing recent drought years as a reason for many people moving into the city to find work.

===Judaism in Casablanca===

There was a Sephardic Jewish community in Anfa up to its destruction by the Portuguese in 1468. Jews were slow to return to the town, but by 1750 the Rabbi Elijah Synagogue was built as the first Jewish synagogue in Casablanca. It was destroyed along with much of the town in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. Today the Jewish cemetery of Casablanca is one of the major cemeteries of the city.

==Main sites==

The French period Ville Nouvelle (New Town) of Casablanca was designed by the French architect Henri Prost, and was a model of a new town at that time. The main streets radiate south and east from Place des Nations Unies, previously the main market of Anfa. Former administrative buildings and modern hotels populate the area. Their style is a combination of Hispano-Mauresque and Art Deco.
Casablanca is home to the Hassan II Mosque, designed by the French architect Michel Pinseau. It is situated on a promontory on the Atlantic. The mosque has room for 25,000 worshippers inside, and a further 80,000 can be accommodated in the mosque's courtyard. Its minaret is the world's tallest at 210 metres. The mosque is also the largest in North Africa, and the third largest in the world.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/morocco/sights/religious-spiritual/hassan-ii-mosque |title=Hassan II Mosque in Morocco, Morocco |publisher=Lonely Planet |date=28 August 2010 |accessdate=17 April 2011[/tpl]
Work on the mosque was started in 1980, and was intended to be completed for the 60th birthday of the former Moroccan king, Hassan II, in 1989. However, the building was not inaugurated until 1993. Authorities spent an estimated $800 million in the construction of the building.
The Parc de la Ligue Arabe (formally called Lyautey) is the city's largest public park. On its edge is the Casablanca Cathedral (Cathédrale Sacré-Coeur). It is no longer in use for religious purposes, but it is open to visitors and a splendid example of Mauresque architecture. The Old Medina (the part of town pre-dating the French protectorate) attracts fewer tourists than the medinas of cities like Fes and Marrakech. However, it has undergone some restoration in recent years. Included in this project have been the western walls of the medina, its skala, or bastion, and its colonial-period clock tower.
A popular site among locals is the small island Marabout de Sidi Abderrahmane. It is possible to walk across to the rocky island at low tide. This outcrop contains the tomb of Sidi Abderrhamane Thaalibi, a Sufi from Baghdad and the founder of Algiers. He is considered a saint in Morocco.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.morocco.com/blog/visiting-the-venerated-site-of-marabout-de-sidi-abderrahmane |title=Visiting the Venerated Site of Marabout de Sidi Abderrahmane – English Blog | By Morocco Channel |publisher=Morocco.com |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=12 June 2012[/tpl] Because of this, many Moroccans make informal pilgrimages to this site "to reflect on life and to seek religious enlightenment". Some believe that the saint possessed magical powers and so his tomb still possesses these powers. People come and seek this magic in order to be cured. Non-Muslims may not enter the shrine.

===Casablanca Marina===

The route is [tpl]convert|31|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] long, with 49 stops, and Y-shaped; further lines are planned in the future.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/casablanca-tram-contracts-awarded.html|accessdate=17 November 2011|publisher=Railway Gazette|title=Casablanca tram contracts awarded[/tpl]

===Air===

Casablanca's main airport is Mohammed V International Airport, Morocco's busiest airport. Regular domestic flights serve Marrakech, Rabat, Agadir, Oujda, and Tangier, Laayoune as well as other cities.
Casablanca is well served by international flights to Europe, especially French and Spanish airports, and has regular connections to North American, Middle Eastern and sub-Saharan African destinations. New York City, Paris, London and Dubai are important primary destinations.
The older, smaller Casablanca-Anfa Airport to the west of the city, that served certain destinations including Damascus, and Tunis, was largely closed to international civilian traffic in 2006. It currently services domestic flights and freight. Casablanca Tit Mellil Airport is located in the nearby community of Tit Mellil.

===Coaches===

CTM coaches (intercity buses) and various private lines run services to most notable Moroccan towns as well as a number of European cities. These run from the Gare Routière on Rue Léon l'Africain in downtown Casablanca.

===Metro===

See also: Casablanca RER or Casablanca metro
An underground railway system is currently being planned, which when constructed will potentially offer some relief to the problems of traffic congestion and poor air quality. The metro will not be ready before 2017, having a length of [tpl]convert|10|km|2|abbr=off[/tpl] and costing 46.7 billion dirhams (approximately 5.8 billion USD).http://www.casablanca.ma/index/docs/deplacement_urbain_casa.pdf However, it should be noted that none of the preparatory works for this project have started. Planners are first busy developing a RER system within the Casablanca city and metropolitan area which resembles a metro (including a [tpl]convert|10|km|0|abbr=on[/tpl] long tunnel).

===Taxis===

Registered taxis in Casablanca are coloured red and known as petit taxis (small taxis), or coloured white and known as grands taxis (big taxis). As is standard Moroccan practice, petits taxis, typically small-four door Dacia Logan, Peugeot 207 or similar cars, provide metered cab service in the central metropolitan areas. Grands taxis, generally older Mercedes-Benz sedans, provide shared mini-bus like service within the city on pre-defined routes, or shared inter-city service. Grands Taxis may also be hired for private service by the hour or day.

===Trains===

Casablanca is served by three principal railway stations run by the national rail service, the ONCF.
Casa-Voyageurs is the main inter-city station, from which trains run south to Marrakech or El Jadida and north to Mohammedia and Rabat, and then on either to Tangier or Meknes, Fes, Taza and Oujda. A dedicated airport shuttle service to Mohammed V International Airport also has its primary in-city stop at this station, for connections on to further destinations.
Casa-Port serves primarily commuter trains operating on the Casablanca – Kenitra rail corridor, with some connecting trains running on to Gare de Casa-Voyageurs. The station provides a direct interchange between train and shipping services, and is located near to several port-area hotels. It is the nearest station to the old town of Casablanca, and to the modern city centre, around the landmark Casablanca Twin Center. Casa-Port station is being rebuilt in a modern and enlarged configuration. During the construction the station is still operational. From 2013 it will provide a close connection from the rail network to the city's new tram network.
Casa-Oasis was originally a suburban commuter station which was fully redesigned and rebuilt in the early twenty-first century, and officially re-opened in 2005 as a primary city rail station. Owing to its new status, all southern inter-city train services to and from Casa-Voyageurs now call at Casa-Oasis. ONCF stated in 2005 that the refurbishment and upgrading of Casa-Oasis to inter-city standards was intended to relieve passenger congestion at Casa-Voyageurs station.

===Sky-trains===

The cost of the 15-18 kilometre suspended metro is 9 billion dirhams, to be partially financed by the French Development Agency (AFD). The tracks will be built on concrete arches, allowing commuters to avoid cross-town traffic.
The congestion problem did not end when the 31-kilometre Casablanca tramway line opened last December. It can only accommodate 250,000 passengers each day. The proposed metro, however, will be able to carry up to 400,000 passengers daily.

Perejil Island (Berber: Tura, [tpl]lang-ar|Jazirat Tura[/tpl], [tpl]lang-es|Isla de Perejil[/tpl]) is a small, uninhabited rocky islet located in the southern shore of the Strait of Gibraltar, 200 metres from the Moroccan coast. Its sovereignty is disputed between Spain and Morocco. It was the subject of an armed incident between the two countries in 2002.

==Name==

The name Isla de Perejil literally means "Parsley Island" in Spanish.[tpl]cite book|author=John Purdy|title=The New Sailing Directory for the Strait of Gibralter and the Western Division of the Mediterranean Sea: Comprehending the Coasts of Spain, France, and Italy, from Cape Trafalgar to Cape Spartivento, the Balearic Isles, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily and the Maltese Islands, with the African Coast, from Tangier to Tripoli, Inclusive ...

It is sometimes referred to in Arabic as "Jazirat al-Ma'danus" (جزيرة معدنوس), which is a translation of "Parsley Island".[tpl]cite book|author=كوهن، عبد الرحمن|title=الدعوة الى الاصلاح: مجموعة افتتاحيات أسبوعية الاصلاح، شتنبر 2002، يونيو 2004|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=l5EFAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=8 July 2013|year=2004|language=Arabic[/tpl]
In Moroccan historical references it is only known as "Tura". In his speech to the Moroccan people commemorating the "Throne Day" on July 30, 2002, the king of Morocco used the name "Tura" exclusively, when he mentioned the armed incident with Spain over the island.King of Morocco speech on July 30, 2002 mentioning Tura island.

==Geography==

The island lies [tpl]convert|250|m|0|abbr=off[/tpl] off the coast of Morocco, [tpl]convert|8|km|0|abbr=off[/tpl] from the Spanish city of Ceuta and [tpl]convert|13.5|km|1|abbr=in[/tpl] from mainland Spain. The island is about [tpl]convert|480|x|480|m|0|abbr=off[/tpl] in size, with an area of 15 ha or [tpl]convert|0.15|km²|2|abbr=out[/tpl]. It has a maximum height of [tpl]convert|74|m|0|abbr=off[/tpl] above sea level.

==History==

In 1415, Portugal, along with the conquest of Ceuta, took possession of the nearby islet from Morocco.[tpl]cite book|author=JULIO REYES RUBIO|title=SALADINO|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5Z7ybout6jgC&pg=PA126|accessdate=8 July 2013|publisher=Editorial Liber Factory|language=Spanish|isbn=978-84-9949-270-4|pages=126–[/tpl] In 1580, Portugal came under the sovereignty of the King of Spain. When the Iberian Union split in 1640, Ceuta remained under Spanish sovereignty.
The islet's sovereignty is disputed by Morocco and Spain. Local Moroccan shepherds used it for grazing of livestock but the vast majority of Spaniards and Moroccans had not heard of the islet until 11 July 2002, when a group of Moroccan soldiers set up base on the islet. The Moroccan government said that they set foot on the island in order to monitor illegal immigration, which justification the Spanish government rejected as there had been little co-operation in the matter to that time (a repeated source of complaint from Spain). After protests from the Spanish government, led by José María Aznar, Morocco replaced the soldiers with cadets from the Moroccan navy, who then installed a fixed base on the island. This further angered the Spanish government and both countries restated their claims to the islet. Almost all European Union member states fully supported Spain's objections, with the exception of France and Portugal, whose government issued a statement regretting the incident.[tpl]Citation needed|date=November 2007[/tpl] Morocco's claims had official support from the Arab League, except for Algeria, which restated its recognition of Spanish sovereignty over the exclaves of Ceuta and Melilla.[tpl]citation needed|date=March 2012[/tpl]
On the morning of 18 July 2002 Spain launched Operation Romeo-Sierra, a military attempt to take over the island. The operation was successful and within hours the Spanish had taken control of the island and custody of the Moroccan naval cadets, who had not resisted the Spanish commando attack force, Grupo de Operaciones Especiales III. The operation was launched in conjunction with the Spanish Navy and Spanish Air Force. The Spanish transferred the captured Moroccans by helicopter to the headquarters of the Guardia Civil in Ceuta, who then transported the cadets to the Moroccan border. Over the course of the same day, the Spanish Legion replaced the commandos, and remained on the island until Morocco, after mediation by the United States, led by Colin Powell,[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/spain-and-morocco-agree-to-differ-over-perejil-649208.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Spain and Morocco agree to differ over Perejil | first=Susan | last=Linnee | date=July 23, 2002 | accessdate=May 22, 2010[/tpl] agreed to return to the status quo ante which existed prior to the Moroccan occupation of the island. The islet is now deserted.

==Sovereignty==

Isla Perejil has no permanent human population. Goats are pastured there, and the Moroccan government expressed worries that smugglers and terrorists, in addition to illegal immigrants, were using the island. The island is well monitored from both sides in order to maintain the status quo that leaves it deserted and virtually a no man's land.
Morocco had demanded the return of the Spanish cities Ceuta and Melilla along with several small rocks and islets off the coast of Morocco. The crisis over Isla Perejil was seen by the Spanish government as a way for Morocco to test the waters in regard to Spain's will to defend Ceuta and Melilla.Ceberia, Monica et al (17 September 2012) The last remains of the empire El Pais in English, Retrieved 24 September 2012
