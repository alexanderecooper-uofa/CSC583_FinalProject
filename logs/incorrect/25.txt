==History==

===Origin of the firm===

The company has its origin as National Dairy Products Corporation (National Dairy), formed on December 10, 1923, by Thomas H. McInnerney.Wall Street Journal, Dec 13 1923[tpl]Page needed|date=August 2011[/tpl] The firm was initially set up to execute on a rollup strategy in the then fragmented United States ice cream industry. Through acquisitions it expanded into a full range of dairy products. By 1930 it was the largest dairy company in the United States and the world, exceeding Borden.
McInnerney operated the Hydrox Corporation, an ice cream company located in Chicago, Illinois. In 1923 he went to Wall Street to convince investment bankers there to finance his scheme for consolidating the United States ice cream industry. He initially found "hard sledding"Wiktionary definition of "sledding" with one banker saying the dairy industry "lacked dignity." He persevered and convinced a consortium including Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers to finance a rollup strategy.Los Angeles Times, July 28, 1929[tpl]Page needed|date=August 2011[/tpl]
As a result of his efforts, National Dairy Products Corporation was formed in 1923 in a merger of McInnerney's Hydrox with Rieck McJunkin Dairy Co of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The resulting firm was then listed on the New York Stock Exchange with the offer of 125,000 shares having been oversubscribed.
The firm grew quickly through a large number of acquisitions. As it is typical in a rollup strategy, acquisitions were primarily for stock in National Dairy rather than cash. National Dairy Products Corporation acquired more than 55 firms between 1923 and 1931, with a few notable entities among those:

===Beginnings for Kraft===

Born in Stevensville, Ontario, Canada in 1874, James L. Kraft immigrated to the United States in 1903 and started a wholesale door-to-door cheese business in Chicago; its first year of operations was "dismal", losing US$3,000 and a horse. However, the business took hold and Kraft was joined by his four brothers to form J.L. Kraft and Bros. Company in 1909. As early as 1911, circulars and advertisements were in use by the company.
In 1912, the company established its New York City, New York, headquarters to prepare for its international expansion. By 1914, thirty-one varieties of cheeses were being sold around the U.S. because of heavy product development, expansion by marketing, and opening a wholly owned cheese factory in Illinois.[tpl]cite web |url= https://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Kraft-Foods-Inc-Company-History.html|title= Kraft Foods Inc.|accessdate= 2008-03-10|year= 2002|publisher= Funding Universe|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6ATYI1FLB |archivedate=August 19, 2010[/tpl]
In 1915, the company had invented pasteurized processed cheese that did not need refrigeration, thus giving a longer shelf life than conventional cheese. The process was patented in 1916 and about six million pounds of the product were sold to the U.S. Army for military rations during World War I.
In 1916, the company began national advertising and had made its first acquisition—a Canadian cheese company.
In 1924, the company changed its name to Kraft Cheese Company and listed on the Chicago Stock Exchange. In 1926, it was listed on the NYSE. The firm then began to consolidate the United States dairy industry through acquisition, in competition with National Dairy and Borden. Firms acquired included:
Later, in 1927, it established its London, United Kingdom, and Hamburg, Germany, sales offices—its first forays outside North America. Sales for 1927 were $60.4m.
In 1928, it acquired Phenix Cheese Company, the maker of a cream cheese branded as Philadelphia cream cheese, and the company changed its name to Kraft-Phenix Cheese Company.
In 1929, The New York Times reported that Kraft Phenix, The Hershey Company and Colgate were looking at merging.New York TImes, October 16, 1929 In the same year, it was reported that National Dairy, Borden and Standard Brands (a firm that is now part of Kraft Foods) were all looking at acquiring the firm.
By 1930, it had captured forty percent of the cheese market in the U.S. and was the third largest dairy company in the United States after National Dairy and Borden. In 1930, the company also began operating in Australia following a merger with Fred Walker & Co.

===After National Dairy acquisition of Kraft-Phenix===

At the time of the acquisition in 1930, National Dairy had sales of $315m compared with $85m for Kraft Phenix. National Dairy management ran the combined business. Following the Kraft-Phenix acquisition, the firm continued to be called National Dairy until 1969 when it changed its name to Kraftco.Kraftco Corporation Annual Report 1969.
Historically, all of the firm's sales came from dairy products. However, the firm's product lines began to diversify away from dairy products to caramel candies, macaroni and cheese dinners and margarines. From the 1950s onward, the firm began to move away from low value added commodity dairy products, such as fluid milk.Compare National Dairy annual report 1938, 1958 and 1976 sales mix data This trend would continue for the firm, through neglect and divestiture, until the primary remaining dairy product produced by the firm would be cheese. As a result, the modern history of the firm emphasizes the cheese history.
In 1933, the company began marketing by radio sponsorship. In 1935, the Sealtest brand of ice cream was launched as a unified national brand to replace the firm's numerous regional brands.
During World War II, the company sent four million pounds of cheese to Britain weekly.
Product development and advertising helped the company to grow during the postwar years, launching sliced process cheese and Cheez Whiz, a brand of process cheese sauce, in the 1950s.
During these years, Thomas McInnerney, National Dairy's founder, and James L. Kraft, Kraft's founder, died, and at the end of the decade, the divisions became less autonomous and even diversified to the glass-packaging business with the acquisition of Metro Glass in 1956.
In 1947, the company tested the marketing power of the emerging medium of television by producing an hour-long drama/anthology series, the Kraft Television Theatre. The product advertised on the program, MacLaren’s Imperial Cheese, was selected because "... had not only had no advertising appropriation whatsoever, but had not even been distributed for several years." As described by internal documents of J. Walter Thompson—the advertising firm which conceived of the marketing test—the result was "although there was no other advertising support for it whatsoever, still grocery stores could not keep up with the demand."[tpl]cite web| title='Kraft'-ing a Durable Business Model| publisher= TelevisionWeek | date=2008-04-27 | url= http://www.tvweek.com/news/2008/04/krafting_a_durable_business_mo.php | accessdate=2008-06-01[/tpl]
In the 1960s, product development became intense, launching fruit jellies, fruit preserves, marshmallows, barbecue sauces and Kraft Singles, a brand of individually wrapped cheese slices. During this decade, the company also expanded in many markets worldwide.
In 1961, the firm acquired Dominion Dairies of Canada, marking the first effort by the firm to expand into fluid milk and ice cream outside the United States.National Dairy annual report 1961, p. 6. In the same year it also acquired The Southern Oil Company in Manchester, England.

===National Dairy becomes Kraft===

In 1969, the firm changed its name from National Dairy to Kraftco Corporation. The reason for the name change was given at the time: "Expansion and innovation have taken us far afield from the regional milk and ice cream business we started with in 1923. Dollar sales of these original products have remained relatively static over the past ten years and, in 1969 accounted for approximately 25% of our sales."Kraftco annual report 1969, p. 3.
At the same time, the firm transferred to Glenview, Illinois, in 1972. In 1976, its name changed to Kraft, Inc. to emphasize the trademark the company had been known for and as a result of the fact that dairy, other than cheese, was now only a minor part of the company's sales. Reorganization also occurred after the name change.

===Dart merger===

In 1980, Kraft merged with Dart Industries—makers of the Duracell brand of batteries, Tupperware brand of plastic containers, West Bend brand of home appliances, Wilsonart brand of plastics and Thatcher glass—to form Dart & Kraft.
During the 1980s, Dart & Kraft offered mixed results to its shareholders, as new acquisitions in the food business—such as Churny premium cheeses, Lender's Bagels, Frusen Gladje ice cream and Celestial Seasonings tea—slightly offset the lagging nonfood business—Tupperware's decrease in sales and KitchenAid's (acquired soon after the merger) slide in market share—leading Dart & Kraft to spin off its nonfood business (except Duracell batteries) into a new entity (Premark International, Inc.) while changing its name back to Kraft, Inc. Premark was bought by Illinois Tool Works in 1999. In 1988, Kraft sold Duracell to private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, who then put it into an initial public offering in 1989. Gillette bought Duracell in 1996, and itself was acquired by Procter and Gamble in 2005.

===Philip Morris acquisition and merger with General Foods===

At the end of 1988, Philip Morris Companies purchased Kraft for $12.9 billion. In 1989, Kraft merged with Philip Morris's General Foods unit—makers of Oscar Mayer meats, Maxwell House coffee, Jell-O gelatin, Budget Gourmet frozen dinners, Entenmann's baked goods, Kool-Aid, Crystal Light and Tang powdered beverage mixes, Post Cereals, Shake 'n Bake flavored coatings and numerous other packaged foods—as Kraft General Foods. Its aggressive product development was reversed after the merger, as it became slow in addressing issues on its product lines due to its size, and also company politics.
In 1990, the company acquired Jacobs Suchard (a European coffee and confectionery giant) and Freia Marabou (a Scandinavian confectionery maker) to expand overseas as its business was heavily dependent on the U.S.  In 1993, it acquired RJR Nabisco's cold cereal business (mainly Shredded Wheat and Shreddies cereals) while selling its Breyers ice-cream division to Unilever and its Birds Eye unit to Dean Foods. In 1994, it sold its frozen dinners unit to H.J. Heinz and in 1995, it sold its foodservice unit.
In 1995, it changed its name to Kraft Foods Inc. The same year, it sold its bakery division (except Lender's Bagels, which was sold in 1996 to CPC International), its candy division and its tablespreads division. Log Cabin syrup was sold in 1997.
Kraft began a major restructuring process in January 2004, following a year of declining sales (blamed largely on the rising health consciousness of Americans) and the sacking of co-CEO Betsy Holden. The company announced closures of 19 production facilities worldwide and the reduction of 5,500 jobs, as well as the sale of 10% of its branded products.
As of 2007, Philip Morris (now Altria Inc.) had sold its stake in Kraft foods and the two companies are no longer affiliated.

===Financial expansion===

In 2000, Philip Morris (renamed Altria in 2003) acquired Nabisco Holdings for $18.9 billion and merged the company with Kraft Foods the same year. In 2001, Philip Morris sold 280 million Kraft shares via the third-largest IPO of all time, retaining an 88.1% stake in the company.
In 2004, it sold its sugar confectionery division to Wrigley, while doing minor divestitures—including its hot cereals division (Cream of Wheat) in 2007, its pet snacks division (Milk-Bone) in 2006, juice drinks and Fruit2o in 2007 and some grocery brands in 2006.[tpl]Clarify|date=December 2011[/tpl]
Investor Nelson Peltz bought a three-percent stake at Kraft Foods and was talking with the executives on revitalizing the business,[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9443091 |title= No ketchup, please |accessdate= 2007-07-17 |date= 2007-07-05 |publisher= The Economist[/tpl] with options such as buying Wendy's fast food chain or selling off Post cereals and Maxwell House coffee.
On January 31, 2007, after months of speculation, the company announced that its 88.1% stake would be spun off to Altria shareholders at the end of March 2007; each would be given approximately 0.7 shares of Kraft for every Altria share they owned. Kraft became an independent publicly held company.
In July 2007, the company bought Groupe Danone's biscuit (cookie) and cereal division for $7.2 billion, including iconic French biscuit brand Lefèvre-Utile.[tpl]cite news |url= http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9476097 |title= Getting better? |accessdate= 2007-07-22 |date= 2007-07-12 |publisher= The Economist[/tpl] While two years earlier firestorms of protest had arisen over plans for American PepsiCo's hostile takeover of the French company, Kraft's announcement was not met with the same protests, in part because Kraft agreed not to close French factories and keep the new merged divisions headquarters near Paris for at least three years.
In November 2007, Kraft agreed to sell its cereal unit to Ralcorp Holdings, a major private-label food maker, for $2.6 billion in a form of a spin-off merger. This would add 50% to Ralcorp's sales, to $3.3 billion, and will be used for Kraft's debt payment, which was at $13.4 billion, in danger of a downgrade by Standard and Poor's.Rrstar.com Rockford Register article[tpl]Clarify|date=October 2009[/tpl]
In February 2008, Berkshire Hathaway run by billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett announced that it had acquired an 8% stake in Kraft then worth over $4 billion. Buffett's business partner Charles Munger had also invested over $300 million in Kraft.  Berkshire Hathaway owned 5.6% of the outstanding stock of Kraft Foods, as reported in the holding company's 2010 annual report.[tpl]cite web| url= http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/2010ar/2010ar.pdf |title= 2010 Annual Report | publisher= Berkshire Hathaway |format=PDF | accessdate=July 20, 2011[/tpl]

====Purchase of Cadbury====

On September 7, 2009, Kraft made a £10.2 billion takeover offer for the long-established British confectionery group Cadbury, makers of Dairy Milk and Bournville chocolate.[tpl]cite web |url = http://phx.corporate-ir.net/External.File?item=UGFyZW50SUQ9MTQ1ODZ8Q2hpbGRJRD0tMXxUeXBlPTM=&t=1 |accessdate = 2009-09-07 |title = Kraft Foods Inc. proposes combination with Cadbury PLC. |date = 2009-09-07 |publisher = Kraft Foods[/tpl] On November 9, 2009 Kraft's £9.8bn takeover bid was rejected by Cadbury.

On January 19, 2010, Cadbury finally approved a revised offer from Kraft, valuing the confectionery business at $19.5 billion (£11.5 billion). The funding for the takeover was partially provided by the Royal Bank of Scotland, the British part-state-owned bank.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/business-food-and-drink/2010/01/company-kraft-cadbury-bid |title=Kraft to take over Cadbury |publisher=New Statesman |date=2010-01-19 |accessdate=2010-01-19[/tpl]

====Acquisition fallout====

Cadbury sales were flat after Kraft’s acquisition. Despite the Cadbury takeover helping boost sales by 30%, Kraft's net profit for the fourth quarter fell 24% to $540m due to costs associated with integrating the UK business after the acquisition.[tpl]cite news|title=Kraft Foods' profits hit by Cadbury costs|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12427830|publisher=BBC|accessdate=11 February 2011|date=February 11, 2011[/tpl] Kraft spent a one-time $1.3 billion in integration costs to achieve $675 million in recurring annual synergy savings by the end of 2012 (estimated).[tpl]cite web|last=STEUBER|first=ERIN|title=Kraft, Cadbury not such a sweet deal?|url=http://news.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news.aspx?id=163092|publisher=Medill Reports|accessdate=April 15, 2010[/tpl]
Kraft was forced to increase prices to offset rising commodity costs in North America and Europe. Kraft has had to contend with the higher cost of ingredients such as corn, sugar and cocoa. Kraft chief executive Irene Rosenfeld said, “We expect it will remain weak for the foreseeable future.” Taking into account integration costs, the acquisition knocked about 33% off Kraft's earnings per share immediately after the purchase of Cadbury. In March 2011, Kraft caused national outrage when they sold the site of a historic Cadbury factory it vowed not to close for £50million after initially publically promising the continuity of production within the UK in order to win over support for the deal from shareholders. Instead, production was immediately outsourced to Poland. The Somerdale Factory was closed just days after the takeover by Kraft Foods in 2009. Former Cadbury workers demanded an apology for the abrupt selling of the plant, but Kraft’s CEO Irene Rosenfeld refused to explain her actions.[tpl]cite web|title=Kraft to sell Cadbury factory for £50 million|url=http://swns.com/kraft-to-sell-cadbury-factory-for-50-million-221318.html|publisher=Small World News Service|accessdate=22 March 2011[/tpl] Kraft continues to use Cadbury brands in emerging markets to expand all of its products. In April 2011, Kraft set to invest $150 million in South Africa’s manufacturing plants over three years.  President Sanjay Khosla said, "South Africa is a priority market for us, where we focus on power brands like Cadbury chocolate."[tpl]cite web| last=Daniels |first=Kurt| title=Kraft Foods (NYSE:KFT) In Huge Manufacturing Investment| url= http://www.emoneydaily.com/kraft-foods-nysekft-in-huge-manufacturing-investment/69812656|publisher=eMoneyDaily|accessdate=22 April 2011[/tpl]
On March 17, 2010, Kraft Foods said it was "truly sorry" over its closure of Cadbury's Somerdale Factory.

====Sale of frozen pizza division to Nestlé====

On March 1, 2010, Nestlé concluded the purchase of Kraft's North American frozen pizza business for $3.7 billion. Kraft left the door open to repurchase with a buyback option not before one year and not after three years for the original sale price of $3.7 billion; but they did not take advantage of the option. The sale included DiGiorno, Tombstone and Jack's brands in the United States, the Delissio brand in Canada and the California Pizza Kitchen trademark license. It also includes two Wisconsin manufacturing facilities in Medford and Little Chute. The business generated 2009 net revenues of $1.6 billion, with 3,400 employees.[tpl]cite web |url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=129070&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1370544&highlight= |title=Kraft Foods Announces Agreement to Sell Pizza Business to Nestlé |publisher=Kraft Foods |date=2010-01-05 |accessdate=2010-01-05[/tpl]

Jell-O is a brand name belonging to Illinois-based Kraft Foods for varieties of gelatin desserts, including fruit gels, puddings and no-bake cream pies. The brand's popularity led to "jello" becoming a generic term for gelatin dessert across the U.S. and Canada.

==Description==

Jell-O is sold prepared (ready to eat) or in powder form, and is available in  colors and flavors. The powder contains powdered gelatin and flavorings, including sugar or artificial sweeteners. It is dissolved in hot water, then chilled and allowed to set.  Fruit, vegetables, and whipped cream can be added to make elaborate snacks that can be molded into shapes. Jell-O must be put in a refrigerator until served, and once set, it can be eaten.
There are non-gelatin pudding and pie filling products sold under the Jell-O brand. Pudding is cooked on the stove top with milk, then eaten warm or chilled until firmly set. Jell-O has an instant pudding product which is mixed with cold milk and chilled. To make pie fillings, the same products are prepared with less liquid.
Although the word Jell-O is a brand name, it is commonly used in the United States as a generic and household name for any gelatin products.

==History==

===Early history===

Gelatin, a protein produced from collagen extracted from the boiled bones, connective tissues, and other animal products, has been a component of food, particularly desserts, since the 1400s.[tpl]cite news|last=Purdom|first=Candace|title=Program on History of Gelatin Breaks the Mold: Shedding Light on Familiar Dessert|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-04-10/news/0104100235_1_gelatin-jell-jell-o|accessdate=20 June 2013|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=April 10, 2001[/tpl]
Gelatin was popularized in the west in the Victorian era with spectacular and complex "jelly moulds". Gelatin was sold in sheets and had to be purified, which was time-consuming.  Gelatin desserts were the province of Royalty and the relatively well-to-do. In 1845, a patent for powdered gelatin was obtained by industrialist Peter Cooper, who built the first American steam-powered locomotive, the Tom Thumb.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT4084|title=IMPROVEMENT IN THE PREPARATION OF ... |work=Google Patent Search[/tpl][tpl]cite web | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/04/nyregion/04jello.html?ex=1210564800&en=11a9dce77358ac6b&ei=5070 | title=Upstate, Where It Was First Made, Unwavering Devotion to Jell-O | work=New York Times | date=May 4, 2008 | accessdate=July 15, 2012 | author=Belson, Ken[/tpl]  This powdered gelatin was easy to manufacture and easier to use in cooking.[tpl]cite web|last=Naglak|first=Gigi|title=There's Always Room|url=http://www.chemheritage.org/discover/media/periodic-tabloid/2011-07-20-theres-always-room.aspx|publisher=Chemical Heritage Foundation|accessdate=20 June 2013[/tpl]
In 1897, in LeRoy, New York, carpenter and cough syrup manufacturer, Pearle Bixby Wait trademarked a gelatin dessert, called Jell-O. He and his wife May added strawberry, raspberry, orange and lemon flavoring to granulated gelatin and sugar.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.jellogallery.org/jellohistory.html|title=History of Jello|work=The Jell-O Gallery|publisher=Le Roy Historical Society|date=27 October 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140213131934/http://www.jellogallery.org/jellohistory.html|archivedate=13 February 2014[/tpl] Then in 1899, Jell-O was sold to Orator Woodward, whose Genesee Pure Food Company produced the successful Grain-O health drink.  (part of the legal agreement between Woodward and Wait dealt with the similar Jell-O name.)[tpl]cite book|last=Wyman|first=Carolyn|title=Jell-O: A Biography — The History and Mystery of America's Most Famous Dessert|year=2001|publisher=Mariner Books|isbn=978-0156011235|pages=4-5[/tpl]

===Going mainstream===

Various elements were key to Jell-O becoming a mainstream product: new technologies, such as refrigeration, powdered gelatin and machine packaging, home economics classes, and the company's marketing.[tpl]cite news |title=Mormonism’s Jell-O Mold |author=Christy Spackman |date=August 17, 2012 |work=Slate.com |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2012/08/jell_o_and_mormonism_the_stereotype_s_surprising_origins_.html |accessdate=August 17, 2012[/tpl]
Initially Woodward struggled to sell the powdered product. Beginning in 1902, to raise awareness, Woodward's Genesee Pure Food Company placed advertisements in the Ladies' Home Journal proclaiming Jell-O to be "America's Most Famous Dessert." Jell-O was a minor success until 1904, when Genesee Pure Food Company sent armies of salesmen into the field to distribute free Jell-O cookbooks, a pioneering marketing tactic.Jell-O Museum | A History of Jell-O Within a decade, three new flavors, chocolate (discontinued in 1927), cherry and peach, were added, and the brand was launched in Canada. Celebrity testimonials and recipes appeared in advertisements featuring actress Ethel Barrymore and opera singer Ernestine Schumann-Heink. Some Jell-O illustrated advertisements were painted by Maxfield Parrish.  
In 1923, the newly rechristened Jell-O Company launched D-Zerta, an artificially sweetened version of Jell-O. Two years later, Postum and Genesee merged, and in 1927 Postum acquired Clarence Birdseye's frozen foods company to form the General Foods Corporation. 
By 1930, there appeared a vogue in American cuisine for congealed salads, and the company introduced lime-flavored Jell-O to complement the  add-ins that cooks across the country were combining in these aspics and salads. Popular Jell-O recipes often included ingredients like cabbage, celery, green peppers, and even cooked pasta.[tpl]cite web|last=Dionisio|first=Jennifer|title=There's Always Room For...|url=http://www.chemheritage.org/discover/media/periodic-tabloid/2010-08-06-theres-always-room-for.aspx|publisher=Chemical Heritage Foundation|accessdate=20 June 2013[/tpl] 
By the 1950s, salads would become so popular that Jell-O responded with savory and vegetable flavors such as celery, Italian, mixed vegetable and seasoned tomato. These savory flavors have since been discontinued.
In 1934, sponsorship from Jell-O made comedian Jack Benny the dessert's spokesperson.[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/640190382/A-timeline-set-in-Jell-O.html?pg=all | work=Deseret News (Salt Lake City) | title=A timeline set in Jell-O | date=June 28, 2006 |accessdate = July 15, 2012| deadurl=no[/tpl] At this time Post introduced a jingle (created by the agency Young & RubicamBusiness – Jell-O pulls plug on longtime ad firm 09/10/00) that would be familiar over several decades, in which the spelling "J-E-L-L-O" was (or could be) sung over a rising five-note musical theme.
In 1936, chocolate returned to the Jell-O lineup, as an instant pudding made with milk. It proved enormously popular and over time other pudding flavors were added such as vanilla, tapioca, coconut, pistachio, butterscotch, egg custard, flan and rice pudding.

===Baby boom===

The baby boom saw a significant increase in sales for Jell-O. Young mothers  didn't have the supporting community structures of earlier generations, so marketers were quick to promote easy-to-prepare prepackaged foods. By this time, creating a Jell-O dessert required simply boiling water, Jell-O and Tupperware molds.
New flavors were continually added and unsuccessful flavors were removed: in the 1950s and 1960s, apple, black cherry, black raspberry, grape, lemon-lime, mixed fruit, orange-banana, pineapple-grapefruit, blackberry, strawberry-banana, tropical fruit and more intense "wild" versions of the venerable strawberry, raspberry and cherry. In 1966, the Jell-O "No-Bake" dessert line was launched, which allowed a cheesecake to be made in 15 minutes. In 1971 packaged prepared pudding called Jell-O Pudding Treats were introduced.  During this period, 1-2-3 Jell-O, a gelatin dessert that separated into three layers as it cooled, was unveiled. Until 1987, 1-2-3 Jell-O was readily found in grocery stores throughout most of the United States, but the dessert is now rare. Jell-O Whip 'n Chill, a mousse-style dessert, was introduced and widely promoted; it remains available in limited areas today.

===Sales decline and turnaround===

In 1964, the slogan "There's always room for Jell-O" was introduced, promoting the product as a "light dessert" that could easily be consumed even after a heavy meal.
Throughout the 1960s through the 1980s, Jell-O's sales steadily decreased. Many Jell-O dishes, such as desserts and Jell-O salads, became special occasion foods rather than everyday items. Marketers blamed this decline on decreasing family sizes, a "fast-paced" lifestyle and women's increasing employment. By 1986, a market study concluded that mothers with young children rarely purchased Jell-O.
To turn things around, Jell-O hired Dana Gioia to stop the decline. The marketing team revisited the Jell-O recipes published in past cookbooks and rediscovered Jigglers, although the original recipe did not use that name. Jigglers are Jell-O snacks molded into fun shapes and eaten as finger food. Jell-O launched a massive marketing campaign, notably featuring Bill Cosby as spokesman. The campaign was a huge success, causing a significant gain.
Cosby became the company's pudding spokesperson in 1974, and continued as the voice of Jell-O for almost thirty years. Over his tenure as the mouthpiece for the company, he would help introduce new products such as frozen Jell-O Pops (in gelatin and pudding varieties); the new Sugar-Free Jell-O, which replaced D-Zerta in 1984 and was sweetened with NutraSweet; Jell-O Jigglers concentrated gummi snacks; and Sparkling Jell-O, a carbonated version of the dessert touted as the "Champagne of Jell-O." In 2010, Cosby returned as Jell-O spokesperson in an on-line web series called "OBKB."[tpl]cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/17/bill-cosby-jell-o-togethe_n_578592.html | work=Huffington Post | title=Bill Cosby & Jell-O: Together Again | date=May 17, 2010[/tpl]
In the 1980s, a Jell-O advertising campaign slogan reminded consumers, "Don't forget--you have to remember to make it." 
In 1990, General Foods merged into Kraft Foods by parent company Philip Morris (now the Altria Group). New flavors were continually introduced: watermelon, blueberry, cranberry, margarita and piña colada among others.  In 2001, Jell-O was declared the "Official State Snack" of Utah,[tpl]cite web | url=http://www.le.state.ut.us/~2001/bills/sbillenr/SR0005.htm | title=Utah Legislature SR0005 | year=2001 | accessdate=July 11, 2012[/tpl] with Governor Michael O. Leavitt declaring an annual "Jell-O Week.""Utah loves Jell-O – official," BBC News, Feb. 6, 2001 During the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, the souvenir pins included one depicting green Jell-O."There's green Jell-O on your lapel... Abundance of food pins are unique to Salt Lake Olympics" Deseret News, Feb 6, 2002
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Jell-O's family-friendly reputation was slightly tarnished by Jell-O shots and Jell-O wrestling.
[tpl]As of|2008[/tpl], there are more than 158 products sold under the Jell-O brand name with 300 million boxes of Jell-O gelatin sold in the United States each year.
Jell-O is  used as a substantial ingredient in a well-known dessert, a "Jell-O mold" the preparation of which requires a mold designed to hold gelatin, and the depositing of small quantities of chopped fruit, nuts, and other ingredients before it hardens to its typical form.  Fresh pineapple, papaya, kiwi, and ginger root cannot be used because they contain enzymes that prevent gelatin from "setting."

==Jell-O shots==

An alternative recipe calls for the addition of an alcoholic beverage to the mix, contributing approximately one third to one half of the liquid added after the gelatin has  dissolved in the boil. A serving of the resulting mixture is called a "Jell-O shot" at parties. The quantity and timing of the addition of the alcohol are vital aspects; it is not possible to make Jell-O shots with only alcohol:
Vodka or rum are used in Jell-O shots, but the shots can be made with almost any alcohol. It is important to adjust the proportions of alcohol and cold water to ensure that the mixture set when experimenting with different types of alcohol. The Jell-O shots can be served in shot glasses or small paper cups; using the paper cups makes it easier for the people to eat it, but shot glasses are more attractive. 
The alcohol in Jell-O shots is contained within the Jell-O, so the body absorbs it slower, causing people to underestimate how much alcohol they have consumed. Drinkers must monitor their intake because of this.The Art & Science of the Jello Shot DrinkStreet.com
The Jell-O shot was claimed to be invented by American singer-songwriter Tom Lehrer in the 1950s to circumvent restrictions on alcoholic beverages at the army base where he was stationed.That Was the Wit That Was SF Weekly. April 19, 2000.

==Manufacturing and tourism==

[tpl]As of|2012[/tpl], LeRoy, New York, is known as the home of Jell-O and has the only Jell-O Museum in the world, located on the main road through the small town. Jell-O was manufactured here until General Foods closed the plant in 1964 and relocated manufacturing to Dover, Delaware. The Jell-O Gallery museum is operated by the Le Roy Historical Society at the Le Roy House and Union Free School, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/|title=National Register Information System|date=2009-03-13|work=National Register of Historic Places|publisher=National Park Service[/tpl]
At the museum, visitors can learn about the history of the dessert from its inception. Visitors starting on East Main Street, follow Jell-O Brick Road, whose stones are inscribed with the names of former factory employees. The museum offers looks at starting materials for Jell-O, such as sturgeon bladder and calves' hooves, and various molds.
The Jell-O plant in Mason City, Iowa, produces America's supply of ready to eat Jell-O gelatin dessert and pudding cups.

==Advertising==

Jack Benny's top-rated radio show did not break for commercials. Instead, announcer, Don Wilson incorporated speeches about Jell-O into the program at appropriate places, to Jack's feigned comic annoyance.  Lucille Ball's My Favorite Husband, the radio predecessor to TV's I Love Lucy, was another popular program sponsored by Jell-O for much of its 124-episode run.
Comedian Bill Cosby is associated with Jell-O and, more famously, Jell-O pudding and he appeared in many commercials promoting both. Shows like MAD TV, The Simpsons  and Saturday Night Live parody Cosby, using Jell-O references like "pudding pop".  In the 1960s, the cast of the sitcom Hogan's Heroes did a commercial with Carol Channing featuring Colonel Hogan, his men, Kommandant Klink and Sergeant Shultz having Jell-O and Dream Whip for dessert. Also, in the first few seasons of the first of Lucille Ball's two 1960s television series, The Lucy Show, cast members including Vivian Vance often did commercials for Jell-O.
In 1995, Jell-O carried the tagline "It's alive!" and had the phrase "J-E-L-L-OOOOOOO!".

===Mormonism===

Blackham including that Utah had been the highest per capita consumer of Jell-O for many years, and how citizens of Utah had rallied to "Take Back the Title" after Des Moines, Iowa exceeded Utah in Jell-O consumption in 1999. The culture of Utah, petitions by Utahans, and campaigning by students of Brigham Young University were also mentioned as reasons for recognizing Jell-O. Bill Cosby, longtime spokesperson for the Jell-O brand, appeared before the Utah Legislature in support of the bill. "He told the assembly that he believes the reason people in Utah love Jell-O is that the snack is perfect for families -- and the people of Utah are all about family."[tpl]cite news |first= Brett |last= Merritt |title= The pudding Papa: Jell-O pitchman Bill Cosby jiggles onto the stage at Abravanel Hall |url= http://www.heraldextra.com/entertainment/article_09897356-c302-5534-82ba-17a33a832601.html |date= 16 October 2003 |newspaper= Provo Daily Herald[/tpl] Jell-O is often served with homemade cookies or cakes and water at LDS Church socials.  
The stereotype of Mormons loving Jell-O is  a recent one. Media reports in 1969 and 1988 on foods popular among Mormons or in Utah make no mention of Jell-O, and a 1988 article mentions Jell-O as a Lutheran tradition. The Cosby advertising campaign and the promotion of Jigglers was more popular in Utah than in other areas, in large part due to higher birth rates among Mormon populations. The stereotype was solidified in 1997 when Kraft foods released sales figures, revealing Salt Lake City to have the highest per-capita Jell-O consumption.
The Jell-O stereotype developed when the LDS church, led by Gordon B. Hinckley, more actively engaged with wider society, such as by giving interviews with the press. As many non-Mormons believed their religious practices strange, they similarly lumped the love of Jell-O as part of the odd aspects of being Mormon. Many speculative explanations of this stereotype attribute it to Mormons' refusal of alcohol and tobacco. Mormons embraced the stereotype of Jell-O consumption to assert their religious and cultural identity.
