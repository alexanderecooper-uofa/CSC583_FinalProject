The Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis), also known as the Komodo monitor, is a large species of lizard found in the Indonesian islands of Komodo, Rinca, Flores, Gili Motang, and Padar.[tpl]cite book|last=Ciofi|first=Claudio|year=2004|title=Varanus komodoensis|work=Varanoid Lizards of the World|pages= 197–204|publisher= Indiana University Press|location= Bloomington & Indianapolis|isbn= 0-253-34366-6[/tpl] A member of the monitor lizard family (Varanidae), it is the largest living species of lizard, growing to a maximum length of [tpl]convert|3|m|ft|0[/tpl] in rare cases and weighing up to approximately [tpl]convert|70|kg|lb[/tpl].

Fossils very similar to V. komodoensis have been found in Australia dating to greater than 3.8 million years ago, and its body size remained stable on Flores, one of the handful of Indonesian islands where it is currently found, over the last 900,000 years, "a time marked by major faunal turnovers, extinction of the island's megafauna, and the arrival of early hominids by 880 ka kiloannums."
As a result of their size, these lizards dominate the ecosystems in which they live.[tpl]cite book |author=Tim Halliday (Editor), Kraig Adler (Editor) |title=Firefly Encyclopedia of Reptiles and Amphibians |publisher=Firefly Books Ltd |location=Hove |year= 2002|pages=112, 113, 144, 147, 168, 169 |isbn=1-55297-613-0[/tpl] Komodo dragons hunt and ambush prey including invertebrates, birds, and mammals. It has been claimed that they have a venomous bite; there are two glands in the lower jaw which secrete several different toxic proteins. The biological significance of these proteins is disputed, but the glands have been shown to secrete an anticoagulant.  Their group behaviour in hunting is exceptional in the reptile world. The diet of big Komodo dragons mainly consists of deer, though they also eat considerable amounts of carrion.  Komodo dragons also occasionally attack humans in the area of West Manggarai Regency where they live in Indonesia.Markus Makur, 'Giant lizard attack: Komodo dragon bites elderly woman on Rinca island', The Jakarta Post, 13 October 2012.  2 hospitalized in Indonesia after Komodo attack', The Jakarta Post, 7 February 2013. 
Mating begins between May and August, and the eggs are laid in September. About 20 eggs are deposited in abandoned megapode nests or in a self-dug nesting hole. The eggs are incubated for seven to eight months, hatching in April, when insects are most plentiful. Young Komodo dragons are vulnerable and therefore dwell in trees, safe from predators and cannibalistic adults. They take about eight to 9 years to mature, and are estimated to live up to 30 years.
Komodo dragons were first recorded by Western scientists in 1910.Varanus komodoensis. Mampam.com (24 August 2007). Retrieved on 8 August 2012. Their large size and fearsome reputation make them popular zoo exhibits. In the wild, their range has contracted due to human activities, and they are listed as vulnerable by the IUCN. They are protected under Indonesian law, and a national park, Komodo National Park, was founded to aid protection efforts.

==Etymology==

The Komodo dragon is also known as the Komodo monitor or the Komodo Island monitor in scientific literature,[tpl]ITIS |id=202168 |taxon=Varanus komodoensis |accessdate=19 June 2007[/tpl] although this is not very common. To the natives of Komodo Island, it is referred to as ora, buaya darat (land crocodile), or biawak raksasa (giant monitor).[tpl]cite web|publisher=American Museum of Natural History|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20100307164050/http://www.amnh.org/nationalcenter/Endangered/ora/ora.html|title=Ora (Komodo Island Monitor or Komodo Dragon)|accessdate=15 January 2007[/tpl]

==Evolutionary history==

The evolutionary development of the Komodo dragon started with the Varanus genus, which originated in Asia about 40 million years ago and migrated to Australia. Around 15 million years ago, a collision between Australia and Southeast Asia allowed the varanids to move into what is now the Indonesian archipelago, extending their range as far east as the island of Timor. The Komodo dragon was believed to have differentiated from its Australian ancestors 4 million years ago. However, recent fossil evidence from Queensland suggests the Komodo dragon evolved in Australia before spreading to Indonesia."Australia was 'hothouse' for killer lizards", ABC, 30 September 2009. Retrieved on 30 September 2009. Dramatic lowering of sea level during the last glacial period uncovered extensive stretches of continental shelf that the Komodo dragon colonized, becoming isolated in their present island range as sea levels rose afterwards.

==Description==

In the wild, an adult Komodo dragon usually weighs around [tpl]convert|70|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl], although captive specimens often weigh more. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, an average adult male will weigh [tpl]convert|79|to|91|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] and measure [tpl]convert|2.59|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl], while an average female will weigh [tpl]convert|68|to|73|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl] and measure [tpl]convert|2.29|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl].[tpl]cite book | author = Wood, Gerald |url = | title =The Guinness Book of Animal Facts and Feats| year = 1983 | isbn = 978-0-85112-235-9[/tpl] The largest verified wild specimen was [tpl]convert|3.13|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl] long and weighed [tpl]convert|166|kg|lb|abbr=on[/tpl], including undigested food.[tpl]cite web |author=Ciofi, Claudio |publisher=Scientific American |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-komodo-dragon |title=The Komodo Dragon|accessdate=21 December 2006[/tpl] The Komodo dragon has a tail as long as its body, as well as about 60 frequently replaced, serrated teeth that can measure up to [tpl]Convert|2.5|cm|0|abbr=on[/tpl] in length. Its saliva is frequently blood-tinged, because its teeth are almost completely covered by gingival tissue that is naturally lacerated during feeding. This creates an ideal culture for the bacteria that live in its mouth. It also has a long, yellow, deeply forked tongue. Komodo dragon skin is reinforced by armoured scales, which contain tiny bones called osteoderms that function as a sort of natural chain-mail.Komodo Dragons. London ZooKomodo Dragon, Varanus komodoensis 1998. Physical Characteristics. San Diego Zoo Global Zoo (1998). This rugged hide makes Komodo dragon skin poorly suited for making into leather. 

===Senses===

As with other Varanids, Komodo dragons have only a single ear bone, the stapes, for transferring vibrations from the tympanic membrane to the cochlea.  This arrangement means they are likely restricted to sounds in the 400 to 2,000 hertz range, compared to humans who hear between 20 and 20,000 hertz.[tpl]cite web |publisher=BBC |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/animals/features/336feature1.shtml |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061116030327/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/animals/features/336feature1.shtml |archivedate=16 November 2006 |title=Komodo Conundrum |accessdate=25 November 2007[/tpl] It was formerly thought to be deaf when a study reported no agitation in wild Komodo dragons in response to whispers, raised voices, or shouts. This was disputed when London Zoological Garden employee Joan Proctor trained a captive specimen to come out to feed at the sound of her voice, even when she could not be seen.[tpl]cite book |author=David Badger; photography by John Netherton |title=Lizards: A Natural History of Some Uncommon Creatures, Extraordinary Chameleons, Iguanas, Geckos, and More |publisher=Voyageur Press |location=Stillwater, MN |year=2002 |pages=32, 52, 78, 81, 84, 140–145, 151 |isbn=0-89658-520-4[/tpl]
The Komodo dragon is able to see as far away as [tpl]convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl],[tpl]clarification needed|date=March 2014[/tpl] but because its retinas only contain cones, it is thought to have poor night vision. The Komodo dragon is able to see in color, but has poor visual discrimination of stationary objects.[tpl]cite web |publisher=National Zoological Park |url=http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/ReptilesAmphibians/Facts/FactSheets/Komododragon.cfm |title=Komodo Dragon Fact Sheet |accessdate=25 November 2007[/tpl]
The Komodo dragon uses its tongue to detect, taste, and smell stimuli, as with many other reptiles, with the vomeronasal sense using the Jacobson's organ, rather than using the nostrils. With the help of a favorable wind and its habit of swinging its head from side to side as it walks, a Komodo dragon may be able to detect carrion from [tpl]Convert|4|–|9.5|km||abbr=on[/tpl] away. It only has a few taste buds in the back of its throat. Its scales, some of which are reinforced with bone, have sensory plaques connected to nerves to facilitate its sense of touch. The scales around the ears, lips, chin, and soles of the feet may have three or more sensory plaques.

==Ecology==

The Komodo dragon prefers hot and dry places, and typically lives in dry, open grassland, savanna, and tropical forest at low elevations. As an ectotherm, it is most active in the day, although it exhibits some nocturnal activity. Komodo dragons are solitary, coming together only to breed and eat. They are capable of running rapidly in brief sprints up to [tpl]Convert|20|km/h|abbr=on[/tpl], diving up to [tpl]Convert|4.5|m|ft|abbr=on[/tpl], and climbing trees proficiently when young through use of their strong claws.[tpl]cite book | last = Burnie | first = David | coauthors = Don E. Wilson | title = Animal | publisher = DK Publishing | year = 2001 | location = New York | pages = 417, 420 | isbn = 0-7894-7764-5[/tpl] To catch out-of-reach prey, the Komodo dragon may stand on its hind legs and use its tail as a support. As it matures, its claws are used primarily as weapons, as its great size makes climbing impractical.
For shelter, the Komodo dragon digs holes that can measure from 1–3 m (3–10 ft) wide with its powerful forelimbs and claws. Because of its large size and habit of sleeping in these burrows, it is able to conserve body heat throughout the night and minimize its basking period the morning after.[tpl]cite book |author=Eric R. Pianka and Laurie J. Vitt; with a foreword by Harry W. Greene |title=Lizards: Windows to the Evolution of Diversity |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=2003 |page=244 |isbn=0-520-23401-4[/tpl] The Komodo dragon hunts in the afternoon, but stays in the shade during the hottest part of the day. These special resting places, usually located on ridges with cool sea breezes, are marked with droppings and are cleared of vegetation. They serve as strategic locations from which to ambush deer.

===Diet===

Komodo dragons are carnivores. Although they eat mostly carrion, they will also ambush live prey with a stealthy approach. When suitable prey arrives near a dragon's ambush site, it will suddenly charge at the animal and go for the underside or the throat. It is able to locate its prey using its keen sense of smell, which can locate a dead or dying animal from a range of up to [tpl]Convert|9.5|km|abbr=on[/tpl]. Komodo dragons have been observed knocking down large pigs and deer with their strong tails.[tpl]cite book |author=Auffenberg, Walter |title=The Behavioral Ecology of the Komodo Monitor |publisher=University Presses of Florida |location=Gainesville, Florida |year=1981 |isbn=0-8130-0621-X[/tpl]
Komodo dragons eat by tearing large chunks of flesh and swallowing them whole while holding the carcass down with their forelegs. For smaller prey up to the size of a goat, their loosely articulated jaws, flexible skulls, and expandable stomachs allow them to swallow prey whole. The vegetable contents of the stomach and intestines are typically avoided. Copious amounts of red saliva the Komodo dragons produce help to lubricate the food, but swallowing is still a long process (15–20 minutes to swallow a goat). A Komodo dragon may attempt to speed up the process by ramming the carcass against a tree to force it down its throat, sometimes ramming so forcefully, the tree is knocked down. To prevent itself from suffocating while swallowing, it breathes using a small tube under the tongue that connects to the lungs. After eating up to 80% of its body weight in one meal, it drags itself to a sunny location to speed digestion, as the food could rot and poison the dragon if left undigested for too long. Because of their slow metabolism, large dragons can survive on as little as 12 meals a year. After digestion, the Komodo dragon regurgitates a mass of horns, hair, and teeth known as the gastric pellet, which is covered in malodorous mucus. After regurgitating the gastric pellet, it rubs its face in the dirt or on bushes to get rid of the mucus, suggesting, like humans, it does not relish the scent of its own excretions.
The largest animals eat first, while the smaller ones follow a hierarchy. The largest male asserts his dominance and the smaller males show their submission by use of body language and rumbling hisses. Dragons of equal size may resort to "wrestling". Losers usually retreat, though they have been known to be killed and eaten by victors.

The Komodo dragon's diet is wide-ranging, and includes invertebrates, other reptiles (including smaller Komodo dragons), birds, bird eggs, small mammals, monkeys, wild boar, goats, deer, horses, and water buffalo.[tpl]cite news |publisher=guardian.co.uk |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jun/12/indonesia |title=The terrifying truth about Komodo dragons |accessdate=19 June 2008 |location=London | first=John | last=Vidal | date=12 June 2008[/tpl] Young Komodos will eat insects, eggs, geckos, and small mammals. Occasionally, they consume humans and human corpses, digging up bodies from shallow graves. This habit of raiding graves caused the villagers of Komodo to move their graves from sandy to clay ground and pile rocks on top of them to deter the lizards.[tpl]cite book |author=Alison Ballance; Morris, Rod |title=South Sea Islands: A Natural History |publisher=Firefly Books Ltd |location=Hove |year= 2003|isbn=1-55297-609-2[/tpl] The Komodo dragon may have evolved to feed on the extinct dwarf elephant Stegodon that once lived on Flores, according to evolutionary biologist Jared Diamond.[tpl]cite journal |last=Diamond |first=Jared M. |year=1987|title=Did Komodo dragons evolve to eat pygmy elephants? |journal=Nature |volume=326 |issue=6116 |page=832 |doi=10.1038/326832a0[/tpl]
The Komodo dragon drinks by sucking water into its mouth via buccal pumping (a process also used for respiration), lifting its head, and letting the water run down its throat.

===Saliva===

Auffenberg described the Komodo dragon as having septic pathogens in its saliva (he described the saliva as "reddish and copious"), specifically the bacteria E. coli, Staphylococcus sp., Providencia sp., Proteus morgani, and P. mirabilis. He noted, while these pathogens can be found in the mouths of wild Komodo dragons, they disappear from the mouths of captive animals, due to cleaner diets and the use of antibiotics.[tpl]cite book |author=Auffenberg, Walter |title=The Behavioral Ecology of the Komodo Monitor |publisher=University Presses of Florida |location=Gainesville |year=1981 |page=406 |isbn=0-8130-0621-X [/tpl]Balsai, Michael Joseph (2001).

UPENN.edu This was verified by taking mucous samples from the external gum surfaces of the upper jaws of two freshly captured individuals. Saliva samples were analyzed by researchers at the University of Texas, who found 57 strains of bacteria growing in the mouths of three wild Komodo dragons, including Pasteurella multocida.[tpl]cite journal|pmid=12238371|year=2002|last1=Montgomery|first1=JM|last2=Gillespie|first2=D|last3=Sastrawan|first3=P|last4=Fredeking|first4=TM|last5=Stewart|first5=GL|title=Aerobic salivary bacteria in wild and captive Komodo dragons|volume=38|issue=3|pages=545–51|journal=Journal of wildlife diseases|url=http://www.jwildlifedis.org/cgi/reprint/38/3/545.pdf|doi=10.7589/0090-3558-38.3.545[/tpl] The rapid growth of these bacteria was noted by Fredeking: "Normally it takes about three days for a sample of P. multocida to cover a Petri dish; ours took eight hours. We were very taken aback by how virulent these strains were". This study supported the observation that wounds inflicted by the Komodo dragon are often associated with sepsis and subsequent infections in prey animals. How the Komodo dragon is unaffected by these virulent bacteria remains a mystery.
Research in 2013 suggested that the bacteria in the mouths of komodo dragons are ordinary and similar to those found in other carnivores. They actually have surprisingly good mouth hygiene. As Bryan Fry put it: "After they are done feeding, they will spend 10 to 15 minutes lip-licking and rubbing their head in the leaves to clean their mouth… Unlike people have been led to believe, they do not have chunks of rotting flesh from their meals on their teeth, cultivating bacteria." The observation of prey dying of sepsis would then be explained by the natural instinct of water buffalos, who are not native to the islands where the Komodo dragon lives, to run into water when attacked. The warm, feces filled water would then cause the infections.Here Be Dragons: The Mythic Bite of the Komodo, Christie Wilcox, discovermagazine  The study used samples from 16 captive dragons (10 adults and six neonates) from three U.S. zoos.[ref]

===Venom===

In late 2005, researchers at the University of Melbourne speculated the perentie (Varanus giganteus), other species of monitors, and agamids may be somewhat venomous. The team believes the immediate effects of bites from these lizards were caused by mild envenomation. Bites on human digits by a lace monitor (V. varius), a Komodo dragon, and a spotted tree monitor (V. scalaris) all produced similar effects: rapid swelling, localized disruption of blood clotting, and shooting pain up to the elbow, with some symptoms lasting for several hours.[tpl]cite journal|year= 2006 |title= Early evolution of the venom system in lizards and snakes|journal= Nature|volume= 439|pages= 584–588|doi = 10.1038/nature04328|url=http://www.naherpetology.org/pdf_files/467.pdf |pmid = 16292255|last1 = Fry|first1 = BG|last2 = Vidal|first2 = N|last3 = Norman|first3 = JA|last4 = Vonk|first4 = FJ|last5 = Scheib|first5 = H|last6 = Ramjan|first6 = SF|last7 = Kuruppu|first7 = S|last8 = Fung|first8 = K|last9 = Hedges|first9 = SB|last10= Richardson|first10= Michael K.|last11= Hodgson|first11= Wayne.

In 2009, the same researchers published further evidence demonstrating Komodo dragons possess a venomous bite. MRI scans of a preserved skull showed the presence of two glands in the lower jaw. The researchers extracted one of these glands from the head of a terminally ill specimen in the Singapore Zoological Gardens, and found it secreted several different toxic proteins. The known functions of these proteins include inhibition of blood clotting, lowering of blood pressure, muscle paralysis, and the induction of hypothermia, leading to shock and loss of consciousness in envenomated prey.Scientists discover deadly secret of Komodo's bite, AFP, 19 May 2009[tpl]cite journal |author=Fry BG, Wroe S, Teeuwisse W, et al. |title=A central role for venom in predation by Varanus komodoensis (Komodo Dragon) and the extinct giant Varanus (Megalania) priscus |journal=Proc.

"Komodo dragons kill with venom, not bacteria, study says". CNN. 20 May 2009. Retrieved on 25 May 2009.
Kurt Schwenk, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Connecticut, finds the discovery of these glands intriguing, but considers most of the evidence for venom in the study to be "meaningless, irrelevant, incorrect or falsely misleading". Even if the lizards have venom-like proteins in their mouths, Schwenk argues, they may be using them for a different function, and he doubts venom is necessary to explain the effect of a Komodo dragon bite, arguing that shock and blood loss are the primary factors.[tpl]cite news|author = Zimmer, Carl|date=May 2009|title=Venom Might Boost Dragons Bite|work= San Diego Tribune |url= http://www3.signonsandiego.com/stories/2009/may/25/1c25komodo183628-venom-may-be-boost-dragons-bite/?uniontrib |accessdate=26 September 2009[/tpl][tpl]cite news|author=Zimmer, Carl|date=18 May 2009|title=Chemicals in Dragon's Glands Stir Venom Debate|work=New York Times|page=D2|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/19/science/19komo.html|accessdate=23 March 2012[/tpl]
Other scientists such as Washington State University's Biologist Kenneth V. Kardong and Toxicologists Scott A. Weinstein and Tamara L. Smith, have stated that this allegation of venom glands "has had the effect of underestimating the variety of complex roles played by oral secretions in the biology of reptiles, produced a very narrow view of oral secretions and resulted in misinterpretation of reptilian evolution". According to these scientists "reptilian oral secretions contribute to many biological roles other than to quickly dispatch prey". These researchers concluded that, "Calling all in this clade venomous implies an overall potential danger that does not exist, misleads in the assess­ment of medical risks, and confuses the biological assessment of squamate biochemical systems".[tpl]cite book|last1=Weinstein|first1=Scott A.|last2=Smith|first2=Tamara L.|last3=Kardong|first3=Kenneth V.|editor=Stephen P.

===Reproduction===

Mating occurs between May and August, with the eggs laid in September. During this period, males fight over females and territory by grappling with one another upon their hind legs, with the loser eventually being pinned to the ground. These males may vomit or defecate when preparing for the fight. The winner of the fight will then flick his long tongue at the female to gain information about her receptivity. Females are antagonistic and resist with their claws and teeth during the early phases of courtship. Therefore, the male must fully restrain the female during coitus to avoid being hurt. Other courtship displays include males rubbing their chins on the female, hard scratches to the back, and licking.[tpl]cite web |publisher=San Diego Zoo |url=http://library.sandiegozoo.org/factsheets/komodo_dragon/komodo.htm |title=Komodo Dragon, Varanus komodoensis |accessdate=27 October 2009[/tpl] Copulation occurs when the male inserts one of his hemipenes into the female's cloaca. Komodo dragons may be monogamous and form "pair bonds", a rare behavior for lizards.
The female lays her eggs in burrows cut into the side of a hill or in the abandoned nesting mounds of the Orange-footed Scrubfowl (a moundbuilder or megapode), with a preference for the abandoned mounds.[tpl]cite journal|url=http://www.komodonationalpark.org/downloads/jessop%20et%20al.%202004e.pdf|title=Distribution, Use and Selection of Nest Type by Komodo Dragons |doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2003.08.005|year=2004|last1=Jessop|first1=Tim S.|last2=Sumner|first2=Joanna|last3=Rudiharto|first3=Heru|last4=Purwandana|first4=Deni|last5=Imansyah|first5=M.Jeri|last6=Phillips|first6=John A.|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=117|issue=5|pages=463[/tpl] Clutches contain an average of 20 eggs, which have an incubation period of 7–8 months. Hatching is an exhausting effort for the neonates, which break out of their eggshells with an egg tooth that falls off soon after. After cutting out, the hatchlings may lie in their eggshells for hours before starting to dig out of the nest. They are born quite defenseless and are vulnerable to predation.
Young Komodo dragons spend much of their first few years in trees, where they are relatively safe from predators, including cannibalistic adults, as juvenile dragons make up 10% of their diets. According to David Attenborough, the habit of cannibalism may be advantageous in sustaining the large size of adults, as medium-sized prey on the islands is rare.[tpl]cite book |author=Attenborough, David |authorlink=David Attenborough|title=Life in Cold Blood |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J |year=2008 |isbn=0-691-13718-8[/tpl] When the young approach a kill, they roll around in fecal matter and rest in the intestines of eviscerated animals to deter these hungry adults.

====Parthenogenesis====

A Komodo dragon at London Zoo named Sungai laid a clutch of eggs in late 2005 after being separated from male company for more than two years. Scientists initially assumed she had been able to store sperm from her earlier encounter with a male, an adaptation known as superfecundation.[tpl]cite news |author=Morales, Alex |publisher=Bloomberg Television |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601082&sid=apLYpeppu8ag&refer=canada |title=Komodo Dragons, World's Largest Lizards, Have Virgin Births |accessdate=28 March 2008 |date=20 December 2006[/tpl] On 20 December 2006, it was reported that Flora, a captive Komodo dragon living in the Chester Zoo in England, was the second known Komodo dragon to have laid unfertilized eggs: she laid 11 eggs, and seven of them hatched, all of them male.Notice by her cage in Chester Zoo in England Scientists at Liverpool University in England performed genetic tests on three eggs that collapsed after being moved to an incubator, and verified Flora had never been in physical contact with a male dragon.

Komodo dragons have the ZW chromosomal sex-determination system, as opposed to the mammalian XY system. Male progeny prove Flora's unfertilized eggs were haploid (n) and doubled their chromosomes later to become diploid (2n) (by being fertilized by a polar body, or by chromosome duplication without cell division), rather than by her laying diploid eggs by one of the meiosis reduction-divisions in her ovaries failing. When a female Komodo dragon (with ZW sex chromosomes) reproduces in this manner, she provides her progeny with only one chromosome from each of her pairs of chromosomes, including only one of her two sex chromosomes. This single set of chromosomes is duplicated in the egg, which develops parthenogenetically.

It has been hypothesized that this reproductive adaptation allows a single female to enter an isolated ecological niche (such as an island) and by parthenogenesis produce male offspring, thereby establishing a sexually reproducing population (via reproduction with her offspring that can result in both male and female young).

==History==

===Discovery by the Western world===

Komodo dragons were first documented by Europeans in 1910, when rumors of a "land crocodile" reached Lieutenant van Steyn van Hensbroek of the Dutch colonial administration.Fothergill, Alastair (10 June 2008). Should we really be scared of the Komodo dragon? Daily Mail Widespread notoriety came after 1912, when Peter Ouwens, the director of the Zoological Museum at Bogor, Java, published a paper on the topic after receiving a photo and a skin from the lieutenant, as well as two other specimens from a collector.[tpl]cite journal|last=Ouwens|first=P.A.|year=1912|title=On a large Varanus species from the island of Komodo|journal=Bull.

===Studies===

The Dutch, realizing the limited number of individuals in the wild, outlawed sport hunting and heavily limited the number of individuals taken for scientific study. Collecting expeditions ground to a halt with the occurrence of World War II, not resuming until the 1950s and 1960s, when studies examined the Komodo dragon's feeding behavior, reproduction, and body temperature. At around this time, an expedition was planned in which a long-term study of the Komodo dragon would be undertaken. This task was given to the Auffenberg family, who stayed on Komodo Island for 11 months in 1969. During their stay, Walter Auffenberg and his assistant Putra Sastrawan captured and tagged more than 50 Komodo dragons.[tpl]cite journal |first=Mark |last=Cheater |title=Chasing the Magic Dragon |journal=National Wildlife Magazine |volume=41 |issue=5 |date=August–September 2003 |publisher=National Wildlife Federation |url=http://www.nwf.org/nationalwildlife/article.cfm?articleId=810&issueId=63 [/tpl] The research from the Auffenberg expedition would prove to be enormously influential in raising Komodo dragons in captivity.[tpl]cite book |author=Trooper Walsh; Murphy, James Jerome; Claudio Ciofi; Colomba De LA Panouse |title=Komodo Dragons: Biology and Conservation (Zoo and Aquarium Biology and Conservation Series) |publisher=Smithsonian Books|location=Washington, D.C.|year=2002|isbn=1-58834-073-2[/tpl] Research after that of the Auffenberg family has shed more light on the nature of the Komodo dragon, with biologists such as Claudio Ciofi continuing to study the creatures.

==Conservation==

The Komodo dragon is a vulnerable species and is found on the IUCN Red List. There are approximately 4,000 to 5,000 living Komodo dragons in the wild. Their populations are restricted to the islands of Gili Motang (100), Gili Dasami (100), Rinca (1,300), Komodo (1,700), and Flores (perhaps 2,000). However, there are concerns that there may presently be only 350 breeding females. To address these concerns, the Komodo National Park was founded in 1980 to protect Komodo dragon populations on islands including Komodo, Rinca, and Padar.[tpl]cite web |publisher=Komodo National Park |url=http://www.komodonationalpark.org/ |title=The official website of Komodo National Park, Indonesia |accessdate=2 February 2007[/tpl] Later, the Wae Wuul and Wolo Tado Reserves were opened on Flores to aid with Komodo dragon conservation.
Komodo dragons avoid encounters with humans. Juveniles are very shy and will flee quickly into a hideout if a human comes closer than about [tpl]convert|100|m|ft[/tpl]. Older animals will also retreat from humans from a shorter distance away. If cornered, they will react aggressively by gaping their mouth, hissing, and swinging their tail. If they are disturbed further, they may start an attack and bite. Although there are anecdotes of unprovoked Komodo dragons attacking or preying on humans, most of these reports are either not reputable or caused by defensive bites. Only a very few cases are truly the result of unprovoked attacks by abnormal individuals, which lost their fear towards humans.

===In captivity===

Komodo dragons have long been great zoo attractions, where their size and reputation make them popular exhibits. They are, however, rare in zoos because they are susceptible to infection and parasitic disease if captured from the wild, and do not readily reproduce. As of May 2009, there were thirteen European, two African, thirty-five North American, one Singaporean, and two Australian institutions that kept Komodo dragons.[tpl]cite web |url=http://app.isis.org/abstracts/Abs50024.asp |title=ISIS Abstracts |publisher=ISIS |accessdate=4 January 2009[/tpl]
The first Komodo dragons were displayed at London Zoo in 1927. A Komodo dragon was exhibited in 1934 at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., but it lived for only two years. More attempts to exhibit Komodo dragons were made, but the lifespan of these creatures was very short, averaging five years in the National Zoological Park. Studies done by Walter Auffenberg, which were documented in his book The Behavioral Ecology of the Komodo Monitor, eventually allowed for more successful managing and reproducing of the dragons in captivity.
A variety of behaviors have been observed from captive specimens. Most individuals are relatively tame within a short period of time,[tpl]cite journal |last=Procter |first=J.B. |date=October 1928 |title=On a living Komodo Dragon Varanus komodoensis Ouwens, exhibited at the Scientific Meeting |journal=Proc.

Even seemingly docile dragons may become aggressive unpredictably, especially when the animal's territory is invaded by someone unfamiliar. In June 2001, a Komodo dragon seriously injured Phil Bronstein, the then husband of actress Sharon Stone, when he entered its enclosure at the Los Angeles Zoo after being invited in by its keeper.

 GUESS TEXT:

CATEGORIES: Middle-earth Dragons

J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium features dragons closely based on those of European legend.
Besides dragon (derived from French), Tolkien variously used the terms drake (the original English term, from Old English draca, in turn from Latin draco) and worm (from Old English wyrm, "serpent", "dragon").[tpl]ME-ref|bolt2[/tpl]

==History==

The dragons were bred by Morgoth during the First Age, when Glaurung, the first dragon, appears. Tolkien's dragons are capable of breeding on their own, and in later ages the Withered Heath is purportedly their spawning ground.

==Taxonomy==

Tolkien designed his own taxonomic system for dragons, based on locomotion and fire-breathing.
Dragons are quadrupedal, like Komodo dragons or other lizards, and are either flightless (Glaurung) or are winged and capable of flight (Ancalagon and Smaug). The first winged dragons appeared during the War of Wrath, the battle that ended the First Age.
Dragons which breathed fire were called Urulóki (singular Urulokë), "Fire-drakes".  It is not entirely clear whether the term "Urulóki" referred only to the first dragons such as Glaurung that could breathe fire but were wingless, or to any dragon that could breathe fire, and thus include Smaug. In Appendix A of The Lord of the Rings Tolkien mentions a "Cold-drake".  It is commonly assumed, though not directly stated, that this term indicates a dragon which cannot breathe fire, rather than one who breathes ice or snow. Further, Tolkien calls a fire-breathing dragon in the non-Middle-earth story Farmer Giles of Ham a "hot" one.
Tolkien calls the dragon Scatha a "long-worm" but does not explicitly explain the term.

==Other characteristics==

All of Tolkien's dragons share a love of treasure (especially gold), subtle intelligence, immense cunning, great physical strength, and a hypnotic power called "dragon-spell". They are extremely powerful and dangerous but mature very slowly. Because of this, Melkor's first attempts to use them against his enemies fail, as they are not yet powerful enough to be useful in battle. Despite their evil beginnings, they are not purely destructive by nature, as can be seen by Smaug, who wants to be left in peace, though he did force out the dwarves in the Lonely Mountain.
Dragon-fire (even that of Ancalagon the Black) is described as not being hot enough to melt the One Ring; however, four of the Dwarven Rings are consumed by Dragon-fire.

==Named dragons==

Tolkien named only four dragons in his Middle-earth writings. Another, Chrysophylax Dives, appears in Farmer Giles of Ham, a story separate from the Middle-earth corpus.

===Glaurung===

Glaurung is the Father of Dragons in Tolkien's legendarium, and the first of the Urulóki, the Fire-drakes of Angband. He has four legs and can breathe fire, but lacks wings. Glaurung can control and enslave Men using his mind. He is slain by Túrin Turambar.

===Ancalagon the Black===

Ancalagon: (Sindarin: rushing jaws from anc 'jaw', alag 'impetuous'[tpl]ME-ref|LROW|The Etymologies, pp. 348, 362[/tpl])
Morgoth bred Ancalagon during the First Age to be the greatest and mightiest of all dragons, and the first of the winged ‘fire-drakes’. He arose from the inferno pits of Angband like a storm of wind and fire as a last defence of the realm of Dor Daedeloth. Near the end of the War of Wrath that pitted Morgoth’s hosts against the Host of the Valar, Morgoth sent Ancalagon leading a fleet of winged dragons from the fortress of Angband to destroy the Dark Lord’s enemies. So powerful was the assault of the dragon fleet that the Host of the Valar was driven back from the gates of Angband onto the ashy plain of Anfauglith.
From the west, Eärendil 'The Blessed' in his powerfully hallowed Elven airborne ship Vingilot, aided by Thorondor and the great Eagles, dueled with Ancalagon and the dragon fleet for an entire day. At length Eärendil prevailed, casting Ancalagon upon the triple-peaked towers of Thangorodrim and destroying both dragon and towers. With his last and mightiest defender slain, Morgoth was soon utterly defeated and made captive, ending the War of Wrath.
Ancalagon the Black is considered to have been the greatest dragon of Middle-earth, undoubtedly the largest, and is often referred to as the ‘father of the winged-drakes’. He was so large his body was able to crush the volcanic Thangorodrim, the highest peaks in Beleriand. Like all other Urulóki, Ancalagon breathed fire, which was said to be hotter than any other known flame.
In 1977, an extinct genus of worms from the Cambrian Burgess Shale was named Ancalagon, inspired by Tolkien's dragon.[tpl]cite web|url=http://burgess-shale.rom.on.ca/en/fossil-gallery/view-species.php?id=96 |title=Ancalagon minor |work=The Burgess Shale |accessdate=19 September 2012[/tpl]

===Scatha===

Scatha was a mighty "long-worm" of the Grey Mountains. Little is known of Scatha except that he was slain by Fram in the early days of the Éothéod.
After slaying Scatha, Fram's ownership of his recovered hoard was then disputed by the Dwarves of that region. Fram rebuked this claim, sending them instead Scatha's teeth, with the words, "Jewels such as these you will not match in your treasuries, for they are hard to come by." This led to his death in a feud with the Dwarves. 
The Éothéod retained at least some of the hoard, and brought it south with them when they settled in Rohan. The horn that Éowyn gave to Merry Brandybuck after the War of the Ring came from this hoard.
His name was likely taken from Anglo-Saxon sceaða, "injurious person, criminal, thief, assassin".[tpl]cn|date=March 2014[/tpl]

===Smaug the Magnificent===

Smaug was the last great dragon of Middle-earth. He was slain by Bard, a descendant of Girion, Lord of Dale. A deadly winged fire-breathing dragon, he was described as red-gold in colour and his underbelly was encrusted with many gemstones from the treasure-pile he commonly slept upon once he had taken control of Erebor (the Lonely Mountain).  The Arkenstone was buried right in the pile he slept on, but Smaug never noticed it.  Smaug had only a single weakness:  there was a hole in his jewel encrusted underbelly on his left breast area. Bilbo Baggins discovered this, which led to Smaug's death above Esgaroth.Tolkien, J. R. R. (1937),Douglas A. Anderson, ed., The Annotated Hobbit, Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2002, ISBN 0-618-13470-0

===Other dragons===

Other dragons were present at the Fall of Gondolin.  In the late Third Age, the dragons bred in the Northern Waste and Withered Heath north of the Ered Mithrin. Dáin I of Durin's folk was killed by a cold-drake.

==Earlier conceptions==

Dragons are already present in The Book of Lost Tales, the earliest Middle-earth-relatedActually, at this stage Tolkien had yet to apply the term "Middle-earth" to his work; he used terms like "the Great Lands" instead. narratives written by Tolkien, starting in 1917. The Book of Lost Tales was eventually posthumously published in two volumes as part of The History of Middle-earth series, which was edited and includes commentary by his son Christopher.
In the earliest drafts of "The Fall of Gondolin", the Lost Tale that is the basis for The Silmarillion, Morgoth (here called Melkor) sends mechanical war machines in the form of dragons against the city; some even serve as armoured personnel carriers for Orcs. These machines do not appear in the published Silmarillion, also edited by Christopher Tolkien, in which real dragons attack the city. As in the later conception of the dragons in the Legendarium, the winged dragons had not yet been devised by Morgoth at the time of the Fall of Gondolin. The first winged dragons were coeval with Ancalagon the Black.[tpl]ME-ref|II[/tpl]

==Non-canon dragons==

When the company Iron Crown Enterprises gained the licensing rights for games made from Tolkien's books, they expanded the selection of named dragons considerably in both Middle-earth Role Playing and The Wizards, a trading card game set in Middle-earth. Also in the real-time strategy game The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II, based on  Peter Jackson's film trilogy, there is a dragon named Drogoth.
In The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar, there are several types of creatures distantly related to dragons. There are giant salamanders, worms (long, quadrupedal serpents) and drakes (smaller, weaker, less intelligent forms of dragons.) There is also an undead dragon in the game, Thorog, resurrected by the forces of the Witch-king of Angmar to aid him in maintaining control over the Misty Mountains. Though not all dragons were mentioned by name in the official texts, names coming from sources other than Tolkien are said not to be "canonical".
In a later expansion of the game, The Lord of the Rings Online: Rise of Isengard, a raid of 12 or 24 players takes place in the lair of Draigoch, another dragon in the Misty Mountains, though much further south in Enedwaith. He, unlike Thorog, is alive, though similarly flies and breathes fire.
In The Lord of the Rings: War in the North, players encounter the dragon Úrgost and must ally with him against Agandaûr.
