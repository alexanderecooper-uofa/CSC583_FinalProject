Rotary International is an international service organization whose stated purpose is to bring together business and professional leaders in order to provide humanitarian services, encourage high ethical standards in all vocations, and help build goodwill and peace in the world. It is a secular organization open to all persons regardless of race, colour, creed, religion, gender, or political preference. There are 34,282 clubs and over 1.2 million members worldwide.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rotary.org/en/AboutUs/Pages/ridefault.aspx |title=Presentation of the Rotary on their website |publisher=Rotary.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-17[/tpl] [tpl]Dead link|date=March 2014[/tpl]  The members of Rotary Clubs are known as Rotarians. Members usually meet weekly for breakfast, lunch or dinner, which is a social event as well as an opportunity to organize work on their service goals.
Rotary's primary motto is "Service above Self"; an earlier motto, "One profits most who serves best".Modified by the 2010 "RI Council on Legislation", from the original  "He profits most who serves the best" — see Rotary International manual, Part 5 (Rotary Marks), online at Rotary Marks.

This objective is set against the "Rotary 4-way Test", used to see if a planned action is compatible with the Rotarian spirit.  The test was developed by Rotarian and entrepreneur Herbert J. Taylor during the Great Depression as a set of guidelines for restoring faltering businesses and was adopted as the standard of ethics by Rotary in 1942. It is still seen as a standard for ethics in business management:Russell, Jeff. "Can You Survive Rotary's Four-Way Test?" Journal of Management in Engineering, May/Jun2000, Vol. 16 Issue 3, p13
The 4-Way Test considers the following questions in respect to thinking, saying or doing:

==History==

===The first years of the Rotary Club===

The first Rotary Club was formed when attorney Paul P. Harris called together a meeting of three business acquaintances in downtown Chicago, at Harris' friend Gustave E. Loehr's office in the Unity Building on Dearborn Street on February 23, 1905.[tpl]cite book |title= Irresistible Empire: America's Advance Through 20th-Century Europe|last= De Grazia|first= Victoria|year= |publisher= Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location= Cambridge| isbn= 0-674-01672-6|page=27[/tpl] and [tpl]cite book|title=Spirito rotariano e impegno associativo nel Lazio meridionale: i Rotary Club di Frosinone, Cassino e Fiuggi, 1959-2005|last= Arnone Sipari, Lorenzo|year= 2006|publisher= University of Cassino Press|location= Cassino|isbn= |page=15[/tpl] In addition to Harris and Loehr (a mining engineer and freemasonhttp://www.rotaryfirst100.org/711/loehr.htm#.UyA41j95NxQ), Silvester Schiele (a coal merchant), and Hiram E. Shorey (a tailor) were the other two who attended this first meeting. The members chose the name Rotary because initially they rotated subsequent weekly club meetings to each other's offices, although within a year, the Chicago club became so large it became necessary to adopt the now-common practice of a regular meeting place.
The next four Rotary Clubs were organized in cities in the western United States, beginning with San Francisco, then Oakland, Los Angeles, and Seattle.  The National Association of Rotary Clubs in America was formed in 1910. On 22 February 1911, the first meeting of the Rotary Club Dublin was held in Dublin, Ireland. This was the first club established outside of North America. In April 1912, Rotary chartered a club in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rotary.org/en/aboutus/history/rotarytimeline/Pages/ridefault.aspx |title=Rotary Timeline[/tpl] marking the first establishment of an American-style service club outside the United States.[tpl]cite journal|title=International Expansion of the American-Style Service Club|journal=Journal of American Culture|date=Summer 1999|first=Thomas A.|last=Wikle|coauthors=|volume= 22|issue= 2|page=45|id= |url=|doi=10.1111/j.1542-734X.1999.2202_45.x [/tpl]  To reflect the addition of a club outside of the United States, the name was changed to the International Association of Rotary Clubs in 1912.
In August 1912, the Rotary Club of London received its charter from the Association, marking the first acknowledged Rotary club outside North America.  It later became known that the Dublin club in Ireland was organized before the London club, but the Dublin club did not receive its charter until after the London club was chartered.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.londonrotaryclub.org.uk/|title=About the Rotary Club of London[/tpl]
During World War I, Rotary in Britain increased from 9 to 22 clubs,[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/global/conflict/ww1/ |title=Rotary in World War 1 |last=Lewis |first=Basil |date=2003-07-03 |publisher=Rotary Global History Fellowship |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5YXXD8TC3 |archivedate=2008-06-13 [/tpl] and other early clubs in other nations included those in Cuba in 1916, China in 1919 and India in 1920.
In 1922,  the name was changed to Rotary International.Wikle, 1999 p. 47. By 1925, Rotary had grown to 200 clubs with more than 20,000 members.[tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.rotary.org/en/aboutus/history/rihistory/pages/ridefault.aspx |title=History of Rotary International - History of Rotary International |publisher=Rotary.org |date=1905-02-23 |accessdate=2012-06-17[/tpl]

===Nazi Germany===

In Germany, no club had been formed before 1927, because of "opposition from the continental clubs".[tpl]cite book | last = De Grazia | first = Victoria | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Irresistible Empire: America's advance through 20th-century Europe | publisher = Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | year = 2005 | location = Cambridge, Mass. | page = 38| url = http://www.columbia.edu/~vd19/ | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-674-01672-6 [/tpl] For a while after 1933, Rotary Clubs 'met with approval' of the Nazi authorities and were considered to offer 'opportunity for party comrades ... to provide enlightenment regarding the nature and policy of the National Socialist movement'.[tpl]cite news |title=Protestant Unity Pressed by Hitler |publisher=New York Times |date=11 July 1933 |page=12 |accessdate=2008-06-15 [/tpl] The Nazis, although they saw international organizations as suspect, had authorised NSDAP members to be members of the Rotary through the Nazi Party's court rulings issued in 1933, 1934 and 1936. In 1937, more than half the Rotarians were Nazi Party members.Fabrice d'Almeida, La vie mondaine sous le nazisme ("High-class life under Nazism"), Paris, Perrin, 2006, ISBN 978-2-262-02162-7, p.155
Six German clubs were formed after Hitler came to power. They came under pressure almost immediately to expel their Jewish members.[ref]
</ref>
Rotary clubs do not appear to have had a unified policy towards the Nazi regime: while several German Rotary Clubs decided to disband their organizations in 1933, others practised a policy of appeasement or collaborated. In Munich, the club removed from its members' list a number of Rotarians, Jewish and non-Jewish, who were politically unacceptable for the regime, including Thomas Mann [tpl]cite book | last = Bischof | first = Erwin | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Thomas Mann and Rotary: How the German author fought against the barbarism of National Socialism | publisher = interforum | year = 2013 | location = Bern. | page = | url = http://www.bischof.ch | doi = | id = | isbn = 9-783-95240992-3 [/tpl] (already in exile in Switzerland).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/global/conflict/munich/index.htm |title=On the History of the rotary Club of Munich |last=Unschuld |first=Paul U. |publisher=Rotary Global History Fellowship |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5YXXD8TC3 |archivedate=2008-05-30 [/tpl] Twelve members resigned in "sympathy with the expelled members".[tpl]cite journal|title=Thomas Mann and the Business Ethic|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|date=October 1985|first=Joseph Gerard|last=Brennan|coauthors=|volume=4|issue=5|page=401|id= |url=|doi=10.1007/BF02388594 [/tpl]
Beginning in 1937, however, hostile articles were published in the Nazi press about Rotary, comparing Rotary with Freemasonry. Soon after that, the perceived connection resulted in two decisions which would jeopardize the existence of Rotary in Germany. In June 1937, the ministry of the interior forbade civil servants to be members of the Rotary; in July 1937, the NSDAP's party court reversed its previous rulings and declared Party and Rotarian membership incompatible as from January 1938.
However, Rotary's cause was advocated before the NSDAP party court by Dr. Grill, Governor for the Rotary 73d district, arguing that the German Rotary was compliant with the goals of the Nazi government, had excluded Freemasons in 1933 and non-Aryans in 1936.Fabrice d'Almeida, ibid., p. 155  Other attempts were made, also by foreign Rotarians,Such as the governor of the Belgian Rotary district, who insisted, in a letter to the NSDAP party court, on the fact that Rotary respects established authority. See d'Almeida, ibid., p. 156. but appeasement failed this time, and, in September 1937, the 73rd district dissolved itself.De Grazia, p. 71. Subsequently, the charter of German clubs was withdrawn by Rotary International.

Rotary Clubs in Spain ceased to operate shortly after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rotaryfirst100.org/global/conflict/ww2/onset/index.htm |title=The Onset of War Closed Clubs in the 1930s and 1940s |accessdate= |last=Lewis |first=Basil |date=2003-03-16 |publisher=Rotary Global History Fellowship |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5YDI6Ujls |archivedate=2008-05-30  [/tpl]
Clubs were disbanded across Europe as follows:

===From 1945 onwards===

Rotary clubs in Eastern Europe and other communist-regime nations were disbanded by 1945-46, but new Rotary clubs were organized in many other countries, and by the time of the national independence movements in Africa and Asia, the new nations already had Rotary clubs.  After the relaxation of government control of community groups in Russia and former Soviet satellite nations, Rotarians were welcomed as club organizers, and clubs were formed in those countries, beginning with the Moscow club in 1990.
In 1985, Rotary launched its PolioPlus program to immunize all of the world's children against polio. As of 2011, Rotary has contributed more than 900 million US dollars to the cause, resulting in the immunization of nearly two billion children worldwide.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rotary.org/aboutrotary/history/todayandtomorrow.html |title=Today and tomorrow, an history of Rotary |publisher=Rotary.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-17[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://one.org/livingproof/en/article/progress-against-polio/?gclid=CM38gMP6g6sCFak65QodYFoO5A%7cProgress |title=Against Polio |publisher=One.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-17[/tpl]

The number of Rotarians has slightly declined in recent years: Between 2002 and 2006, they went from 1,245,000 to 1,223,000 members. North America accounts for 450,000 members, Asia for 300,000, Europe for 250,000, Latin America for 100,000, Oceania for 100,000 and Africa for 30,000.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.rotary.org/newsroom/downloadcenter/pdfs/memb_graphs06.pdf |title=Current membership 2006 |publisher=Rotary.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-17[/tpl]

===Rotary International Presidents 2001–present===

==Organization and administration==

In order to carry out its service programs, Rotary is structured in club, district and international levels. Rotarians are members of their clubs. The clubs are chartered by the global organisation Rotary International (RI) headquartered in Evanston, Illinois. For administrative purposes, the more than 32,000 clubs worldwide are grouped into 529 districts, and the districts into 34 zones.

===Club===

The Rotary Club is the basic unit of Rotary activity, and each club determines its own membership.  Clubs originally were limited to a single club per city, municipality, or town, but Rotary International has encouraged the formation of one or more additional clubs in the largest cities when practical.  Most clubs meet weekly, usually at a mealtime on a weekday in a regular location, when Rotarians can discuss club business and hear from guest speakers.  Each club also conducts various service projects within its local community, and participates in special projects involving other clubs in the local district, and occasionally a special project in a "sister club" in another nation.  Most clubs also hold social events at least quarterly and in some cases more often.
Each club elects its own president and officers among its active members for a one-year term. The clubs enjoy considerable autonomy within the framework of the standard constitution and the constitution and bylaws of Rotary International. The governing body of the club is the Club Board, consisting of the club president (who serves as the Board chairman), a president-elect, club secretary, club treasurer, and several Club Board directors, including the immediate past president and the President Elect.  The president usually appoints the directors to serve as chairs of the major club committees, including those responsible for club service, vocational service, community service, youth service, and international service.

===District level===

A district governor, who is an officer of Rotary International and represents the RI board of directors in the field, leads his/her respective Rotary district. Each governor is nominated by the clubs of his/her district, and elected by all the clubs meeting in the annual RI District Convention held each year.  The district governor appoints assistant governors from among the Rotarians of the district to assist in the management of Rotary activity and multi-club projects in the district.

===Zone level===

Approximately 15 Rotary districts form a zone. A zone director, who serves as a member of the RI board of directors, heads two zones. The zone director is nominated by the clubs in the zone and elected by the convention for the terms of two consecutive years.

===Rotary International===

Rotary International is governed by a board of directors composed of the international president, the president-elect, the general secretary, and 17 zone directors.  The nomination and the election of each president is handled in the one- to three-year period before he takes office, and is based on requirements including geographical balance among Rotary zones and previous service as a district governor and board member.  The international board meets quarterly to establish policies and make recommendations to the overall governing bodies, the RI Convention and the RI Council on Legislation.
The chief operating officer of RI is the general secretary, who heads a staff of about 600 people working at the international headquarters in Evanston and in seven international offices around the world.

==Membership==

According to its constitutions ("Charters"), Rotary defines itself as a non-partisan, non-sectarian organization. It is open to business and professional leaders aged 18 and upwards, with no regard to economic status. [tpl]cite web|title=Constitution of Rotary International|url=https://www.rotary.org/myrotary/en/governance-documents|publisher=Rotarian International|accessdate=4 April 2014[/tpl] 
One can contact a Rotary club to inquire about membership but can join a Rotary club only if invited; there is no provision to join without an invitation as each prospective Rotarian requires a sponsor who is an existing Rotarian.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.rotary.org/en/AboutUs/JoiningRotary/Pages/ridefault.aspx |title=Joining Rotary is by invitation only |author=Rotary International |accessdate=2008-03-11[/tpl] Some clubs, though not all, have exclusivist membership criteria: reputation and business or professional leadership may be a specific evaluation criterion for issuing invitations to join, and representation from a specific profession or business may be limited to a percentage of a specific club's membership.

===Active membership===

Active membership is by invitation from a current Rotarian, to professionals or businesspersons working in diverse areas of endeavour.  Each club may limit up to ten percent of its membership representing each business or profession in the area it serves. The goal of the clubs is to promote service to the community they work in, as well as to the wider world. Many projects are organised for the local community by a single club, but some are organised globally.

===Honorary membership===

Honorary membership is given by election of a Rotary Club to people who have distinguished themselves by meritorious service in the furtherance of Rotary ideals. Honorary membership is conferred only in exceptional cases. Honorary members are exempt from the payment of admission fees and dues. They have no voting privileges and are not eligible to hold any office in their club. Honorary membership is time limited and terminates automatically at the end of the term, usually one year. It may be extended for an additional period or may also be revoked at any time. Examples of honorary members are heads of state or former heads of state,Examples can be found all around the world, such as Albert I, King of the Belgians, Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, Winston Churchill, Hassan II of Morocco, John F. Kennedy, Angela Merkel, Augusto Pinochet and Prince Rainier III, but although for instance a majority of presidents of the United States appear to have been honorary members, it is difficult to say as a rule that all heads of state receive—or accept—honorary membership. famous scientistsSuch as Thomas A. Edison and Thor Heyerdahl or other famous people.Such as astronauts (Neil A. Armstrong), military (Douglas MacArthur) or entertainment (Walt Disney) people. See Famous Honorary Rotarians for more examples.

===Female membership===

From 1905 until the 1980s, women were not allowed membership in Rotary clubs, although Rotarian spouses, including Paul Harris' wife, were often members of the similar "Inner Wheel" club. Women did play some roles, and Paul Harris' wife made numerous speeches.  In 1963, it was noted that the Rotary practice of involving wives in club activities had helped to break down female seclusion in some countries.Bird, John "The Wonderful, Wide, Backslapping World Of Rotary." Saturday Evening Post 2/9/1963, Vol. 236 Issue 5, p58–62 Clubs such as Rotary had long been predated by women's voluntary organisations, which started in the United States as early as 1790.Wikle 1999, p 50.
The first Irish clubs discussed admitting women as members in 1912, but the proposal floundered over issues of social class.  Gender equity in Rotary moved beyond the theoretical question when in 1976, the Rotary Club of Duarte in Duarte, California admitted three women as members.  After this club refused to remove the women from membership, in 1978 Rotary International revoked the club's charter.  The Duarte club filed suit in the California courts, claiming that Rotary Clubs are business establishments subject to regulation under California's Unruh Civil Rights Act, which bans discrimination based on race, gender, religion or ethnic origin. Rotary International then appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. The RI attorney argued that "... decision threatens to force us to take in everyone, like a motel".[tpl]cite web |title= High Court Rules that Rotary Clubs Must Admit Women |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6D61439F936A35756C0A961948260 |date=1987-05-05 |accessdate=2008-03-11 |author=Stuart Taylor Jr. |publisher=New York Times[/tpl] The Duarte Club was not alone in opposing RI leadership; the Seattle-International District club unanimously voted to admit women in 1986.Rotary International California District website http://www.rotary5220.org/stay_informed/women.htm.

Women currently account for 15% of international Rotary membership (22% in North America.) In 2013, Anne L. Matthews, a Rotarian from South Carolina, began her term as the first female vice president of Rotary International.http://www.rotary.org/en/MediaAndNews/News/Pages/130702_news_matthews.aspx  Also in 2013, Nan McCreadie was appointed as the first female president of Rotary International in Great Britain and Ireland (RIBI).http://www.fundraising.co.uk/news/2013/06/25/nan-mccreadie-become-rotary039s-first-female-president#sthash.KfC2sc6p.dpuf The first woman to join Rotary in Ghana, West Africa was Hilda Danquah (Rotary Club of Cape Coast)in 1992. The first woman president in Ghana was Dr. Naana Agyeman-Mensah in 2001 (Rotary Club of Accra-Airport). Up until 2013, there has been 46 women presidents in the 30 Rotary clubs in Ghana. In 2013, Stella Dongo from Zimbabwe was appointed District Governor for District 9210 (Zimbabwe/Zambia/Malawi/Northern-Mozambique) for the Rotary year 2013-2014 making her the first female District Governor in the region. She had previously held the offices of Assistant Governor (2006/8), District Administrator (2008/9) and President of The Rotary Club of Highlands (2005/6). She was also Zimbabwe's Country Coordinator (2009/10). Stella, who is a Master PRLS 5 Graduate has been recognised and awarded various District awards including Most Able President for year 2005/6 and Assistant Governor of the year 2006/7 and a Paul Harris Fellow.http://www.rotarydistrict9210.org/districtcommittee/dgsprofile.html
The change of the second Rotarian motto in 2004, from "He profits most who serves best" to "They profit most who serve best", 99 years after its foundation, illustrates the move to general acceptance of women members in Rotary.

===Minority membership===

The first Rotary Clubs in Asia were Manila,The Rotary Club of Manila sponsored the establishment of the Philippine Council of the Boy Scouts of America in 1923. in the Philippines, and Shanghai, in China, each in July 1919.  Rotary's office in Illinois immediately began encouraging the Rotary Club of Shanghai to recruit Chinese members, “believing that when a considerable number of the native
business and professional men have been so honoured, the Shanghai Club will begin to realize its period of greatest success.”   As part of considering the application of a Club to be chartered in Kolkata (then Calcutta), in India in January 1920 and Tokyo, in Japan in October 1920, Rotary formally considered the issue of racial restriction in membership and determined that the organization could not allow racial restrictions to the organization's growth.  In Rotary's legislative deliberations in June 1921, it was formally determined that racial restrictions would not be permitted.  Non-racialism was included in the terms of the standard constitution in 1922, required to be adopted by all member Clubs.
Rotary and other service clubs in the last decade of the 20th century became open to homosexual membership.Quittner, Jeremy. "Join the Club." Advocate, 4/16/2002, Issue 861 Other minorities, in the face of general changes in demographics and declining membership, are also encouraged to join.

==Programs==

===Interact===

Interact is Rotary International’s service club for young people ages 12 to 18. Interact clubs are sponsored by individual Rotary clubs, which provide support and guidance, but they are self-governing and self-supporting.
Club membership varies greatly. Clubs can be single gender or mixed, large or small. They can draw from the student body of a single school or from two or more schools in the same community.
Each year, Interact clubs complete at least two community service projects, one of which furthers international understanding and goodwill. Through these efforts, Interactors develop a network of friendships with local and overseas clubs and learn the importance of
As one of the most significant and fastest-growing programs of Rotary service, with more than 33,000 clubs in more than 200 countries and geographical areas, Interact has become a worldwide phenomenon. Almost 340,000 young people are involved in Interact.

===RYLA===

RYLA, or Rotary Youth Leadership Awards is a leadership program for high school students across the globe that aims to unite and provide resources for future leaders.

===Rotaract===

Rotaract: a service club for young men and women aged 18 to 30 with around 215,000 members in 9,388 clubs in 176 countries. Rotaract was founded in 1968 by Charlotte North Rotary Club, located in Charlotte, North Carolina, USA. Rotaract clubs are either community or university based, and they are sponsored by a local Rotary club. This makes them true "partners in service" and key members of the family of Rotary.[tpl]cite web|author=|url=http://www.rotary.org/en/studentsandyouth/youthprograms/rotaract/pages/ridefault.aspx |title=Rotaract - Home |publisher=Rotary.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-17[/tpl]

===PolioPlus===

The most notable current global project, PolioPlus, is contributing to the global eradication of polio.
Sergio Mulitsch di Palmenberg (1923–1987), Governor of RI District 204 (1984–1985), founder of the RC of Treviglio and Pianura Bergamasca (Italy), was the man who inspired and promoted the RI PolioPlus vaccination campaign.David C. Forward, "A Century of Service. The story of Rotary International", Evanston, 2009. Mulitsch made it possible shipping the first 500,000 doses of antipolio vaccine to the Philippines at the beginning of 1980.Franco Pellaschiar, “Corrispondenza, atti, attestati e stralci di documenti sull’impegno di Sergio Mulitsch per l’Operazione PolioPlus”, In “Realtà Nuova”, anno LXVII, n.3, Milano, 2003. This project later gave rise to the NGO “Nuovi Spazi al Servire” co-ordinated by Luciano Ravaglia (RC Forlì, Italy).Luciano Ravaglia, "L’eredità di Sergio Mulitsh: “Nuovi spazi al servire”, l’Istituto Ong fra rotariani italiani” In “Realtà Nuova”, anno LXVII, n.3, Milano, 2003.
Since beginning the project in 1985, Rotarians have contributed over US$850 million and hundreds of thousands of volunteer-hours, leading to the inoculation of more than two billion of the world's children. Inspired by Rotary's commitment, the World Health Organization (WHO) passed a resolution in 1988 to eradicate polio by 2000.  Now a partner in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) with WHO, UNICEF and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Rotary is recognized by the United Nations as the key private partner in the eradication effort.
In 2008, Rotary received a $100 million challenge grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Rotary committed to raising $100 million. In January 2009, Bill Gates announced a second challenge grant of $255 million. Rotary again committed to raising another $100 million. In total, Rotary will raise $200 million by June 30, 2012. Together, the Gates Foundation and Rotary have committed $555 million toward the eradication of polio. At the time of the second challenge grant, Bill Gates said:
There has been some limited criticism concerning the program for polio eradication. There are some reservations regarding the adaptation capabilities of the virus in some of the oral vaccines, which have been reported to cause infection in populations with low vaccination coverage.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vaccinealliance.org/Resources_Documents/Immunization_Focus/Download/Dec2002SpecialFeature.php |title=Polio: can immunization ever stop? |accessdate=2008-06-22 |last=Brown |first=Phyllida |date=December 2002 |work=Immunization Focus |publisher=Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030203195445/www.vaccinealliance.org/home/Resources_Documents/Immunization_Focus/Download/Dec2002SpecialFeature.php |archivedate=2003-02-03 [/tpl] As stated by Vaccine Alliance, however, in spite of the limited risk of polio vaccination, it would neither be prudent nor practicable to cease the vaccination program until there is strong evidence that "all wild poliovirus transmission been stopped". In a 2006 speech at the Rotary International Convention, held at the Bella Center in Copenhagen, Bruce Cohick stated that polio in all its known wild forms would be eliminated by late 2008, provided efforts in Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India all proceed with their current momentum.Rotary International Polio Facts 2006 Accessed 24 January 2007. This document appears to be updated quarterly.  As of October 2012, Nigeria, Afghanistan, and Pakistan still had wild polio, but it had been eliminated in India.Global Polio Eradication Initiative

===Exchanges and scholarships===

Some of Rotary's most visible programs include Rotary Youth Exchange, a student exchange program for students in secondary education, and the Rotary Foundation's oldest program, Ambassadorial Scholarships.  Today, there are six different types of Rotary Scholarships.  More than 38,000 men and women from 100 nations have studied abroad under the auspices of Ambassadorial Scholarship, and today it is the world's largest privately funded international scholarships program. In 2006-07 grants totaling approximately US$15 million were used to award some 800 scholarships to recipients from 69 countries who studied in 64 nations.
The Exchange Students of Rotary Club Munich International publish their experiences on a regular basis on Rotary Youth Exchange with Germany. In July 2009 the Rotary Foundation ended funding for the Cultural and Multi-Year Ambassadorial Scholarships as well as Rotary Grants for University Teachers.Rotary.org: Announcements
Rotary Fellowships, paid by the foundation launched in honor of Paul Harris in 1947, specialize in providing graduate fellowships around the world, usually in countries other than their own in order to provide international exposure and experience to the recipient.Bird, 1963. p62. Recently, a new program was established known as the Rotary peace and Conflict Resolution program which provides funds for two years of graduate study in one of eight universities around the world.  Rotary is naming about seventy five of these scholars each year.  The applications for these scholarships are found on line but each application must be endorsed by a local Rotary Club.  Children and other close relatives of Rotarians are not eligible.

===Rotary Centers for International Studies===

Starting in 2002, The Rotary Foundation partnered with eight universities around the world to create the Rotary Centers for International Studies in peace and conflict resolution.  The universities include International Christian University (Japan), University of Queensland (Australia), Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris (Sciences Po) (France), University of Bradford (United Kingdom), Universidad del Salvador (Argentina), University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (U.S.), Duke University (U.S.), Chulalongkorn University (Thailand) and University of California, Berkeley (U.S.)  Since then, the Rotary Foundation's Board of Trustees has dropped its association with the Center in France at the Paris Institute of Political Studies and is currently ending its association with the University of California, Berkeley.
Rotary World Peace Fellows complete two-year masters level programs in conflict resolution, peace studies, and international relations.  The first class graduated in 2004.http://www.rotary.org/foundation/educational/amb_scho/centers/index.html As with many such university programs in "peace and conflict studies", questions have been raised concerning political bias and controversial grants. As of August 2006, the Rotary Foundation had spent $18 million on its "peace and conflict" Centers, and the average grant was about $60,000 per enrollee in the two-year program.
In 2004, Fellows established the Rotary World Peace Fellows Association to promote interaction among Fellows, Rotarians, and the public on issues related to peace studies.http://groups.google.com/group/rotarypeace

De Poelen or De Puollen  is a smock mill in Dronrijp, Friesland, Netherlands which was built in 1850. The mill is listed as a Rijksmonument, number 28612.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.molens.nl/dbase/molen.php?&molenid=811 |title=Technische gegevens |publisher=De Hollandsche Molen |language=Dutch |accessdate=10 January 2010[/tpl] (Click on "Technische gegevens" to view.)

==History==

De Poelen was built in 1850. It was built to drain the [tpl]convert|365|ha|acre[/tpl] Oosterpolder.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.molens.nl/dbase/molen.php?&molenid=811 |title=Geschiedenis |publisher=De Hollandsche Molen |language=Dutch |accessdate=10 January 2010[/tpl] (Click on "Geschiedenis" to view.) During its working life, the mill was fitted with Patent sails which had Dekkerised leading edges. The mill was restored in 1984-85, after years out of use and in decline.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.molendatabase.nl/nederland/molen.php?nummer=61 |title=Dronrijp, Friesland |publisher=Molendatabase |language=Dutch |accessdate=10 January 2010[/tpl] De Poelen was officially reopened on 27 April 1985.[tpl]cite book | first = | last =Stichting De Fryske Mole | year = 1995| month = | title = Friese Molens| pages = p179| publisher = Friese Pers Boekerij bv| location = Leeuwarden |language=Dutch |isbn= 90-330-1522-6[/tpl] The mill now only pumps water in a circuit for demonstration purposes.

==Description==

De Poelen is what the Dutch describe as a "grondzeiler" . It is a three-storey smock mill on a single-storey base. There is no stage, the sail reaching almost to the ground. The smock and cap thatched. The mill is winded by tailpole and winch. The sails are Common sails. They have a span of [tpl]convert|19.10|m|ftin[/tpl]. The sails are carried on a cast-iron windshaft, which is bored through to take the striking rod for Patent sails. The windshaft also carries the brake wheel which has 58 cogs. This drives the wallower (35 cogs) at  the top of the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft, the crown wheel, which has 53 cogs drives a gearwheel with 38 cogs on the axle of the Archimedes' screw. The axle of the screw is [tpl]convert|350|mm|ftin[/tpl] diameter and the screw is [tpl]convert|1.50|m|ftin[/tpl] diameter and [tpl]convert|4.50|m|ftin[/tpl] long. The screw is inclined at 20°. Each revolution of the screw lifts [tpl]convert|919|l|impgal[/tpl] of water.

==Public access==

De Poelen is open to the public by appointment.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.molens.nl/dbase/molen.php?&molenid=811 |title=Informatie |publisher=De Hollandsche Molen |language=Dutch |accessdate=10 January 2010[/tpl] (Click on "Informatie" to view.)
