Richard Milhous Nixon (January 9, 1913 – April 22, 1994) was the 37th President of the United States, serving from 1969 to 1974, when he became the only president to resign the office. Nixon had previously served as a Republican U.S. Representative and Senator from California and as the 36th Vice President of the United States from 1953 to 1961.
Nixon was born in Yorba Linda, California. He graduated from Whittier College in 1934 and Duke University School of Law in 1937, returning to California to practice law. He and his wife, Pat Nixon, moved to Washington to work for the federal government in 1942. He subsequently served in the United States Navy during World War II. Nixon was elected in California to the House of Representatives in 1946 and to the Senate in 1950. His pursuit of the Alger Hiss case established his reputation as a leading anti-communist, and elevated him to national prominence. He was the running mate of Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Republican Party presidential nominee in the 1952 election. Nixon served for eight years as vice president. He waged an unsuccessful presidential campaign in 1960, narrowly losing to John F. Kennedy, and lost a race for Governor of California in 1962. In 1968, he ran again for the presidency and was elected.
Although Nixon initially escalated America's involvement in the Vietnam War, he subsequently ended U.S. involvement by 1973. Nixon's visit to the People's Republic of China in 1972 opened communications between the two nations and eventually led to the normalization of diplomatic relations.  He initiated détente and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviet Union the same year. Domestically, his administration generally embraced policies that transferred power from Washington to the states. Among other things, he launched initiatives to fight cancer and illegal drugs, imposed wage and price controls, enforced desegregation of Southern schools, implemented environmental reforms, and introduced legislation to reform healthcare and welfare. Though he presided over the lunar landings beginning with Apollo 11, he replaced manned space exploration with shuttle missions. He was re-elected by a landslide in 1972.
Nixon's second term saw a crisis in the Middle East, resulting in an oil embargo and the restart of the Middle East peace process, as well as a continuing series of revelations about the Watergate scandal. The scandal escalated, costing Nixon much of his political support, and on August 9, 1974, he resigned in the face of almost certain impeachment and removal from office. After his resignation, he accepted a pardon issued by his successor, Gerald Ford.  In retirement, Nixon's work as an elder statesman, authoring nine books and undertaking many foreign trips, helped to rehabilitate his public image. He suffered a debilitating stroke on April 18, 1994, and died four days later at the age of 81.

==Early life==

Nixon was born to Francis A. Nixon and Hannah (Milhous) Nixon, on January 9, 1913, in a house his father built, in Yorba Linda, California.[tpl]sfn|NPS, Nixon Birthplace[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Ferris|p=209[/tpl] His mother was a Quaker (his father converted from Methodism after his marriage), and his upbringing was marked by conservative Quaker observances of the time, such as refraining from alcohol, dancing, and swearing. Nixon had four brothers: Harold (1909–33), Donald (1914–87), Arthur (1918–25), and Edward (born 1930).[tpl]sfn|Nixon Library, Childhood[/tpl] Four of the five Nixon boys were named after kings who had ruled in historical or legendary England; Richard, for example, was named after Richard the Lionheart.[tpl]sfn|Aitken|p=11[/tpl] Nixon's father was Scotch-Irish while his mother was German, English, and Irish.Nixon Genealogy - President Richard Nixon Family History
Nixon's early life was marked by hardship, and he later quoted a saying of Eisenhower to describe his boyhood: "We were poor, but the glory of it was we didn't know it".[tpl]sfn|Aitken|p=12[/tpl] The Nixon family ranch failed in 1922, and the family moved to Whittier, California. In an area with many Quakers, Frank Nixon opened a grocery store and gas station.[tpl]sfn|Aitken|p=21[/tpl] Richard's younger brother Arthur died in 1925 after a short illness.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1987|p=41[/tpl] At the age of twelve, Richard was found to have a spot on his lung and, with a family history of tuberculosis, he was forbidden to play sports. Eventually, the spot was found to be scar tissue from an early bout of pneumonia.[tpl]sfn|Aitken|p=27[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1987|pp=56–57[/tpl]

===Primary and secondary education===

Young Richard attended East Whittier Elementary School, where he was president of his eighth-grade class.[tpl]sfn|Black|p=16[/tpl] His parents believed that attendance at Whittier High School had caused Richard's older brother Harold to live a dissolute lifestyle before the older boy fell ill of tuberculosis (he died of the disease in 1933). Instead, they sent Richard to the larger Fullerton Union High School.[tpl]sfn|Morris|p=89[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Black|pp=17–19[/tpl] He received excellent grades, even though he had to ride a school bus for an hour each way during his freshman year—later, he lived with an aunt in Fullerton during the week.[tpl]sfn|Morris|p=91[/tpl] He played junior varsity football, and seldom missed a practice, even though he was rarely used in games.[tpl]sfn|Morris|p=92[/tpl] He had greater success as a debater, winning a number of championships and taking his only formal tutelage in public speaking from Fullerton's Head of English, H. Lynn Sheller. Nixon later remembered Sheller's words, "Remember, speaking is conversation ... don't shout at people. Talk to them. Converse with them."[tpl]sfn|Aitken|p=28[/tpl] Nixon stated that he tried to use the conversational tone as much as possible.[tpl]sfn|Aitken|p=28[/tpl]
His parents permitted Richard to transfer to Whittier High School for his junior year, beginning in September 1928. At Whittier High, Nixon suffered his first electoral defeat, for student body president. He generally rose at 4 a.m., to drive the family truck into Los Angeles and purchase vegetables at the market. He then drove to the store to wash and display them, before going to school. Harold had been diagnosed with tuberculosis the previous year; when their mother took him to Arizona in the hopes of improving his health, the demands on Richard increased, causing him to give up football. Nevertheless, Richard graduated from Whittier High third in his class of 207 students.[tpl]sfn|Black|pp=20–23[/tpl]

===Collegiate and law school education===

Nixon was offered a tuition grant to attend Harvard University, but Harold's continued illness and the need for their mother to care for him meant Richard was needed at the store. He remained in his hometown and attended Whittier College, his expenses there covered by a bequest from his maternal grandfather.[tpl]sfn|Black|pp=23–24[/tpl] Nixon played for the basketball team; he also tried out for football, but lacked the size to play. He remained on the team as a substitute, and was noted for his enthusiasm.[tpl]sfn|Gellman|p=15[/tpl] Instead of fraternities and sororities, Whittier had literary societies. Nixon was snubbed by the only one for men, the Franklins; many members of the Franklins were from prominent families but Nixon was not. He responded by helping to found a new society, the Orthogonian Society.[tpl]sfn|Black|pp=24–25[/tpl] In addition to the society, schoolwork, and work at the store, Nixon found time for a large number of extracurricular activities, becoming a champion debater and gaining a reputation as a hard worker.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1987|p=61[/tpl] In 1933, he became engaged to Ola Florence Welch, daughter of the Whittier police chief. The two broke up in 1935.[tpl]sfn|Aitken|pp=58–63[/tpl]
After his graduation from Whittier in 1934, Nixon received a full scholarship to attend Duke University School of Law.[tpl]sfn|Nixon Library, Student & Sailor[/tpl] The school was new and sought to attract top students by offering scholarships.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1987|pp=33–34[/tpl] It paid high salaries to its professors, many of whom had national or international reputations.[tpl]sfn|Aitken|p=67[/tpl] The number of scholarships was greatly reduced for second- and third-year students, forcing recipients into intense competition.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1987|pp=33–34[/tpl] Nixon not only kept his scholarship but was elected president of the Duke Bar Association,[tpl]sfn|Parmet|p=81[/tpl] inducted into the Order of the Coif,[tpl]sfn|Nixon Library, Family Collection Guide[/tpl] and graduated third in his class in June 1937.[tpl]sfn|Nixon Library, Student & Sailor[/tpl] He later wrote of his alma mater: "I always remember that whatever I have done in the past or may do in the future, Duke University is responsible in one way or another."[tpl]sfn|Blythe|p=7[/tpl]

==Early career, marriage and war service==

After graduating from Duke, Nixon initially hoped to join the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He received no response to his letter of application and learned years later that he had been hired, but his appointment had been canceled at the last minute due to budget cuts.[tpl]sfn|Aitken|p=76[/tpl] Instead, he returned to California and was admitted to the bar in 1937. He began practicing with the law firm Wingert and Bewley in Whittier,[tpl]sfn|Nixon Library, Student & Sailor[/tpl] working on commercial litigation for local petroleum companies and other corporate matters, as well as on wills.[tpl]sfn|Aitken|pp=79–82[/tpl] In later years, Nixon proudly stated that he was the only modern president to have previously worked as a practicing attorney. Nixon was reluctant to work on divorce cases, disliking frank sexual talk from women.[tpl]sfn|Morris|p=193[/tpl] In 1938, he opened up his own branch of Wingert and Bewley in La Habra, California,[tpl]sfn|Black|p=44[/tpl] and became a full partner in the firm the following year.[tpl]sfn|Black|p=43[/tpl]
In January 1938, Nixon was cast in the Whittier Community Players production of The Dark Tower. There he played opposite a high school teacher named Thelma "Pat" Ryan.[tpl]sfn|Nixon Library, Student & Sailor[/tpl] Nixon described it in his memoirs as "a case of love at first sight"[tpl]sfn|Nixon|1978|p=23[/tpl]—for Nixon only, as Pat Ryan turned down the young lawyer several times before agreeing to date him.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1987|pp=93, 99[/tpl] Once they began their courtship, Ryan was reluctant to marry Nixon; they dated for two years before she assented to his proposal. They wed at a small ceremony on June 21, 1940. After a honeymoon in Mexico, the Nixons began their married life in Whittier.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1987|pp=100–101[/tpl] They had two children, Tricia (born 1946) and Julie (born 1948).[tpl]sfn|Nixon Library, Nixon Family[/tpl]
In January 1942, the couple moved to Washington, D.C., where Nixon took a job at the Office of Price Administration.[tpl]sfn|Nixon Library, Student & Sailor[/tpl] In his political campaigns, Nixon would suggest that this was his response to Pearl Harbor, but he had sought the position throughout the latter part of 1941. Both Nixon and his wife believed he was limiting his prospects by remaining in Whittier.[tpl]sfn|Morris|pp=124–126[/tpl] He was assigned to the tire rationing division, where he was tasked with replying to correspondence. He did not enjoy the role, and four months later, applied to join the United States Navy.[tpl]sfn|Kornitzer|pp=143-144[/tpl] As a birthright Quaker, he could have claimed exemption from the draft, and deferments were routinely granted for those in government service. His application was successful, and he was inducted into the Navy in August 1942.[tpl]sfn|Aitken|pp=96–97[/tpl]
Nixon completed Officers Candidate School and was commissioned as an ensign in October 1942. His first post was as aide to the commander of the Naval Air Station Ottumwa in Iowa. Seeking more excitement, he requested sea duty and was reassigned as the naval passenger control officer for the South Pacific Combat Air Transport Command, supporting the logistics of operations in the South West Pacific theater.[tpl]sfn|Naval Historical Center, Commander Nixon[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Black|pp=58–60[/tpl] He was Officer in Charge of the Combat Air Transport Command at Guadalcanal in the Solomons and later at Green Island (Nissan island) just north of Bougainville. His unit prepared manifests and flight plans for C-47 operations and supervised the loading and unloading of the cargo aircraft. For this service he received a Letter of Commendation for "meritorious and efficient performance of duty as Officer in Charge of the South Pacific Combat Air Transport Command" On October 1, 1943, Nixon was promoted to lieutenant.  Nixon earned two service stars and that citation of commendation, although he saw no actual combat. Upon his return to the US, Nixon was appointed the administrative officer of the Alameda Naval Air Station in California. In January 1945, he was transferred to the Bureau of Aeronautics office in Philadelphia to help negotiate the termination of war contracts, and he received another letter of commendation for his work there.[tpl]sfn|Black|p=62[/tpl] Later, Nixon was transferred to other offices to work on contracts and finally to Baltimore.[tpl]sfn|Aitken|p=112[/tpl] In October 1945, he was promoted to lieutenant commander.[tpl]sfn|Black|p=62[/tpl] He resigned his commission on New Year's Day 1946.[tpl]sfn|Black|pp=62–63[/tpl]

==Rising politician==

===Congressional career===

In 1945, Republicans in California's 12th congressional district, frustrated by their inability to defeat Democratic Congressman Jerry Voorhis, sought a consensus candidate who would run a strong campaign against him. They formed a "Committee of 100" to decide on a candidate, hoping to avoid internal dissensions which had led to Voorhis victories. After the committee failed to attract higher-profile candidates, Herman Perry, Whittier's Bank of America branch manager, suggested Nixon, a family friend with whom he had served on the Whittier College Board of Trustees before the war. Perry wrote to Nixon in Baltimore. After a night of excited talk between the Nixons, the naval officer responded to Perry with enthusiasm. Nixon flew to California and was selected by the committee. When he left the Navy at the start of 1946, Nixon and his wife returned to Whittier, where Nixon began a year of intensive campaigning.[tpl]sfn|Parmet|pp=91–96[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Gellman|pp=27–28[/tpl]  He contended that Voorhis had been ineffective as a congressman and suggested that Voorhis's endorsement by a group linked to communists meant that Voorhis must have radical views.[tpl]sfn|Parmet|pp=111–113[/tpl] Nixon won the election, receiving 65,586 votes to Voorhis' 49,994.[tpl]sfn|Gellman|p=82[/tpl]
In Congress, Nixon supported the Taft–Hartley Act of 1947, a federal law that monitors the activities and power of labor unions, and served on the Education and Labor Committee. He was part of the Herter Committee, which went to Europe to report on the need for U.S. foreign aid. Nixon was the youngest member of the committee, and the only Westerner.[tpl]sfn|Gellman|pp=105–107, 125–126[/tpl] Advocacy by Herter Committee members, including Nixon, led to congressional passage of the Marshall Plan.[tpl]sfn|Morris|p=365[/tpl]
Nixon first gained national attention in 1948 when his investigation, as a member of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), broke the Alger Hiss spy case. While many doubted Whittaker Chambers' allegations that Hiss, a former State Department official, had been a Soviet spy, Nixon believed them to be true and pressed for the committee to continue its investigation. Under suit for defamation filed by Hiss, Chambers produced documents corroborating his allegations.  These included paper and microfilm copies that Chambers turned over to House investigators after having hidden them overnight in a field; they became known as the "Pumpkin Papers". [tpl]sfn|Black|pp=129–135[/tpl] Hiss was convicted of perjury in 1950 for denying under oath he had passed documents to Chambers.[tpl]sfn|Gellman|pp=239–241[/tpl] In 1948, Nixon successfully cross-filed as a candidate in his district, winning both major party primaries,[tpl]sfn|Morris|p=381[/tpl] and was comfortably reelected.[tpl]sfn|Nixon Library, Congressman[/tpl]
In 1949, Nixon began to consider running for the United States Senate against the Democratic incumbent, Sheridan Downey,[tpl]sfn|Gellman|p=282[/tpl] and entered the race in November of that year.[tpl]sfn|Morris|p=535[/tpl] Downey, faced with a bitter primary battle with Representative Helen Gahagan Douglas, announced his retirement in March 1950.[tpl]sfn|Gellman|pp=296–297[/tpl] Nixon and Douglas won the primary elections[tpl]sfn|Gellman|p=304[/tpl] and engaged in a contentious campaign in which the ongoing Korean War was a major issue.[tpl]sfn|Gellman|p=310[/tpl] Nixon tried to focus attention on Douglas' liberal voting record. As part of that effort, a "Pink Sheet" was distributed by the Nixon campaign suggesting that, as Douglas' voting record was similar to that of New York Congressman Vito Marcantonio (believed by some to be a communist), their political views must be nearly identical.[tpl]sfn|Morris|p=581[/tpl] Nixon won the election by almost twenty percentage points.[tpl]sfn|Gellman|p=335[/tpl]
In the Senate, Nixon took a prominent position in opposing global communism, traveling frequently and speaking out against the threat.[tpl]sfn|Nixon Library, Senator[/tpl] He maintained friendly relations with his fellow anti-communist, the controversial Wisconsin senator, Joseph McCarthy, but was careful to keep some distance between himself and McCarthy's allegations.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1987|pp=211, 311–312[/tpl] Nixon also criticized President Harry S. Truman's handling of the Korean War.[tpl]sfn|Nixon Library, Senator[/tpl] He supported statehood for Alaska and Hawaii, voted in favor of civil rights for minorities, and supported federal disaster relief for India and Yugoslavia.[tpl]sfn|Black|p=178[/tpl] He voted against price controls and other monetary restrictions, benefits for illegal immigrants, and public power.[tpl]sfn|Black|p=178[/tpl]

===Vice Presidency===

thumb|A piece of literature for the Eisenhower–Nixon campaign, 1952[tpl]further|Checkers speech[/tpl]
General Dwight D. Eisenhower was nominated for president by the Republicans in 1952. He had no strong preference for a vice presidential candidate, and Republican officeholders and party officials met in a "smoke-filled room" and recommended Nixon to the general, who agreed to the senator's selection. Nixon's youth (he was then 39), stance against communism, and his political base in California—one of the largest states—were all seen as vote-winners by the leaders. Among the candidates considered along with Nixon were Ohio Senator Robert Taft, New Jersey Governor Alfred Driscoll and Illinois Senator Everett Dirksen.[tpl]sfn|Gellman|pp=440–441[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Aitken|pp=205–206[/tpl] On the campaign trail, Eisenhower spoke to his plans for the country, leaving the negative campaigning to his running mate.[tpl]sfn|Aitken|pp=222–223[/tpl]
In mid-September, the Republican ticket faced a major crisis.John W. Malsberger, “Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, and the Fund Crisis of 1952,” Historian, 73 (Fall 2011), pp 526–47. The media reported that Nixon had a political fund, maintained by his backers, which reimbursed him for political expenses.[tpl]sfn|Kornitzer|pp=191[/tpl] Such a fund was not illegal, but it exposed Nixon to allegations of possible conflict of interest. With pressure building for Eisenhower to demand Nixon's resignation from the ticket, the senator went on television to deliver an address to the nation on September 23, 1952.[tpl]sfn|Aitken|pp=210–217[/tpl] The address, later termed the Checkers speech, was heard by about 60 million Americans—including the largest television audience up to that point.[tpl]sfn|Thompson|p=291[/tpl] Nixon emotionally defended himself, stating that the fund was not secret, nor had donors received special favors. He painted himself as a man of modest means (his wife had no mink coat; instead she wore a "respectable Republican cloth coat") and a patriot.[tpl]sfn|Aitken|pp=210–217[/tpl] The speech would be remembered for the gift which Nixon had received, but which he would not give back: "a little cocker spaniel dog ... sent all the way from Texas. And our little girl—Tricia, the 6-year-old—named it Checkers."[tpl]sfn|Aitken|pp=210–217[/tpl] The speech was a masterpiece and prompted a huge public outpouring of support for Nixon.[tpl]sfn|Aitken|p=218[/tpl] Eisenhower decided to retain him on the ticket,[tpl]sfn|Morris|p=846[/tpl] which proved victorious in the November election.[tpl]sfn|Aitken|pp=222–223[/tpl]
Eisenhower had pledged to give Nixon responsibilities during his term as vice president that would enable him to be effective from the start as a successor. Nixon attended Cabinet and National Security Council meetings and chaired them when Eisenhower was absent. A 1953 tour of the Far East succeeded in increasing local goodwill toward the United States and prompted Nixon to appreciate the potential of the region as an industrial center. He visited Saigon and Hanoi in French Indochina.[tpl]sfn|Aitken|pp=225–227[/tpl] On his return to the United States at the end of 1953, Nixon increased the amount of time he devoted to foreign relations.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1987|p=342[/tpl]
Biographer Irwin Gellman, who chronicled Nixon's congressional years, said of his vice presidency:

Despite intense campaigning by Nixon, who reprised his strong attacks on the Democrats, the Republicans lost control of both houses of Congress in the 1954 elections. These losses caused Nixon to contemplate leaving politics once he had served out his term.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1987|pp=357–358[/tpl] On September 24, 1955, President Eisenhower suffered a heart attack; his condition was initially believed to be life-threatening. Eisenhower was unable to perform his duties for six weeks. The 25th Amendment to the United States Constitution had not yet been proposed, and the Vice President had no formal power to act. Nonetheless, Nixon acted in Eisenhower's stead during this period, presiding over Cabinet meetings and ensuring that aides and Cabinet officers did not seek power.[tpl]sfn|Aitken|pp=256–258[/tpl] According to Nixon biographer Stephen Ambrose, Nixon had "earned the high praise he received for his conduct during the crisis ... he made no attempt to seize power".[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1987|pp=375–376[/tpl]
His spirits buoyed, Nixon sought a second term, but some of Eisenhower's aides aimed to displace him. In a December 1955 meeting, Eisenhower proposed that Nixon not run for reelection in order to give him administrative experience before a 1960 presidential run and instead become a Cabinet officer in a second Eisenhower administration. Nixon, however, believed such an action would destroy his political career. When Eisenhower announced his reelection bid in February 1956, he hedged on the choice of his running mate, stating that it was improper to address that question until he had been renominated. Although no Republican was opposing Eisenhower, Nixon received a substantial number of write-in votes against the President in the 1956 New Hampshire primary election. In late April, the President announced that Nixon would again be his running mate.[tpl]sfn|Aitken|pp=237–241[/tpl] Eisenhower and Nixon were reelected by a comfortable margin in the November 1956 election.[tpl]sfn|Parmet|p=294[/tpl]
In the spring of 1957, Nixon undertook another major foreign trip, this time to Africa. On his return, he helped shepherd the Civil Rights Act of 1957 through Congress. The bill was weakened in the Senate, and civil rights leaders were divided over whether Eisenhower should sign it. Nixon advised the President to sign the bill, which he did.[tpl]sfn|Black|pp=349–352[/tpl] Eisenhower suffered a mild stroke in November 1957, and Nixon gave a press conference, assuring the nation that the Cabinet was functioning well as a team during Eisenhower's brief illness.[tpl]sfn|Black|p=355[/tpl]
On April 27, 1958, Richard and Pat Nixon embarked on a goodwill tour of South America. In Montevideo, Uruguay, Nixon made an impromptu visit to a college campus, where he fielded questions from students on U.S. foreign policy. The trip was uneventful until the Nixon party reached Lima, Peru, where he was met with student demonstrations. Nixon went to the campus, got out of his car to confront the students, and stayed until forced back into the car by a volley of thrown objects. At his hotel, Nixon faced another mob, and one demonstrator spat on him.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1987|pp=465–469[/tpl] In Caracas, Venezuela, Nixon and his wife were spat on by anti-American demonstrators and their limousine was attacked by a pipe-wielding mob.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1987|pp=469–479[/tpl] According to Ambrose, Nixon's courageous conduct "caused even some of his bitterest enemies to give him some grudging respect".[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1987|p=463[/tpl]
In July 1959, President Eisenhower sent Nixon to the Soviet Union for the opening of the American National Exhibition in Moscow. On July 24, while touring the exhibits with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, the two stopped at a model of an American kitchen and engaged in an impromptu exchange about the merits of capitalism versus communism that became known as the "Kitchen Debate".[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1987|pp=521–525[/tpl]

===1960 and 1962 elections; wilderness years===

In 1960, Nixon launched his first campaign for President of the United States. He faced little opposition in the Republican primaries[tpl]sfn|UPI 1960 in Review[/tpl] and chose former Massachusetts Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. as his running mate.[tpl]sfn|Nixon Library, Vice President[/tpl] His Democratic opponent was John F. Kennedy, and the race remained close for the duration.[tpl]sfn|Museum of Broadcast Communications, "Kennedy-Nixon Debates"[/tpl] Nixon campaigned on his experience, but Kennedy called for new blood and claimed the Eisenhower–Nixon administration had allowed the Soviet Union to overtake the U.S. in ballistic missiles (the "missile gap").[tpl]sfn|Steel|2003-05-25[/tpl] A new political medium was introduced in the campaign: televised presidential debates. In the first of four such debates, Nixon appeared pale, with a five o'clock shadow, in contrast to the photogenic Kennedy.[tpl]sfn|Nixon Library, Vice President[/tpl] Nixon's performance in the debate was perceived to be mediocre in the visual medium of television, though many people listening on the radio thought that Nixon had won.[tpl]sfn|Foner|p=843[/tpl] Nixon lost the election narrowly, with Kennedy ahead by only 120,000 votes (0.2 percent) in the popular vote.[tpl]sfn|Nixon Library, Vice President[/tpl]
There were charges of vote fraud in Texas and Illinois, both states won by Kennedy; Nixon refused to consider contesting the election, feeling a lengthy controversy would diminish the United States in the eyes of the world, and the uncertainty would hurt U.S. interests.[tpl]sfn|Carlson|2000-11-17[/tpl] At the end of his term of office as vice president in January 1961, Nixon and his family returned to California, where he practiced law and wrote a bestselling book, Six Crises, which included coverage of the Hiss case, Eisenhower's heart attack, and the Fund Crisis, which had been resolved by the Checkers speech.[tpl]sfn|Nixon Library, Vice President[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Black|p=431[/tpl]
Local and national Republican leaders encouraged Nixon to challenge incumbent Pat Brown for Governor of California in the 1962 election.[tpl]sfn|Nixon Library, Vice President[/tpl] Despite initial reluctance, Nixon entered the race.[tpl]sfn|Nixon Library, Vice President[/tpl] The campaign was clouded by public suspicion that Nixon viewed the office as a stepping-stone for another presidential run, some opposition from the far-right of the party, and his own lack of interest in being California's governor.[tpl]sfn|Nixon Library, Vice President[/tpl] Nixon hoped that a successful run would confirm him in his status as the nation's leading active Republican politician, and ensure he remained a major player in national politics.[tpl]sfn|Black|pp=432–433[/tpl] Instead, he lost to Brown by more than five percentage points, and the defeat was widely believed to be the end of his political career.[tpl]sfn|Nixon Library, Vice President[/tpl] In an impromptu concession speech the morning after the election, Nixon blamed the media for favoring his opponent, saying, "You won't have Nixon to kick around anymore because, gentlemen, this is my last press conference".[tpl]sfn|Aitken|pp=304–305[/tpl] The California defeat was highlighted in the November 11, 1962, episode of ABC's Howard K. Smith: News and Comment entitled "The Political Obituary of Richard M. Nixon".[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1987|p=673[/tpl] Alger Hiss appeared on the program, and many members of the public complained that it was unseemly to allow a convicted felon air time to attack a former vice president. The furor drove Smith and his program from the air,[tpl]sfn|Museum of Broadcast Communications, "Smith, Howard K."[/tpl] and public sympathy for Nixon grew.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1987|p=673[/tpl]
The Nixon family traveled to Europe in 1963, where Nixon gave press conferences and met with leaders of the countries he visited.[tpl]sfn|Black|p=446[/tpl] The family moved to New York City, where Nixon became a senior partner in the leading law firm Nixon, Mudge, Rose, Guthrie & Alexander.[tpl]sfn|Nixon Library, Vice President[/tpl] Nixon had pledged, when announcing his California campaign, not to run for president in 1964; even if he had not, he believed it would be difficult to defeat Kennedy, or after his assassination, Kennedy's successor, Lyndon Johnson.[tpl]sfn|Aitken|pp=297, 321[/tpl] In 1964, he supported Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater for the Republican nomination for president; when Goldwater was successful in gaining the nomination, Nixon was selected to introduce the candidate to the convention. Although he thought Goldwater unlikely to win, Nixon campaigned for him loyally. The election was a disaster for the Republicans; Goldwater's landslide loss to Johnson was matched by heavy losses for the party in Congress and among state governors.[tpl]sfn|Aitken|pp=321–322[/tpl]
Nixon was one of the few leading Republicans not blamed for the disastrous results, and he sought to build on that in the 1966 congressional elections. He campaigned for many Republicans seeking to regain seats lost in the Johnson landslide and received credit for helping the Republicans make major gains in the midterm election.[tpl]sfn|Aitken|pp=323–326[/tpl]

==1968 presidential election==

At the end of 1967, Nixon told his family he planned to run for president a second time. Although Pat Nixon did not always enjoy public life[tpl]sfn|Parmet|p=502[/tpl] (for example, she had been embarrassed by the need to reveal how little the family owned in the Checkers speech),[tpl]sfn|Morris|pp=410–411[/tpl] she was supportive of her husband's ambitions. Nixon believed that with the Democrats torn over the issue of the Vietnam War, a Republican had a good chance of winning, although he expected the election to be as close as in 1960.[tpl]sfn|Parmet|p=502[/tpl]
One of the most tumultuous primary election seasons ever began as the Tet Offensive was launched, followed by the withdrawal of President Johnson as a candidate after doing unexpectedly poorly in the New Hampshire primary; it concluded with the assassination of one of the Democratic candidates, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, just moments after his victory in the California primary. On the Republican side, Nixon's main opposition was Michigan Governor George Romney, though New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller and California Governor Ronald Reagan each hoped to be nominated in a brokered convention. Nixon secured the nomination on the first ballot.[tpl]sfn|Parmet|pp=503–508[/tpl] He selected Maryland Governor Spiro Agnew as his running mate, a choice which Nixon believed would unite the party, appealing to both Northern moderates and Southerners disaffected with the Democrats.[tpl]sfn|Parmet|p=509[/tpl]
Nixon's Democratic opponent in the general election was Vice President Hubert Humphrey, who was nominated at a convention marked by violent protests.[tpl]sfn|Nixon Library, President[/tpl] Throughout the campaign, Nixon portrayed himself as a figure of stability during a period of national unrest and upheaval.[tpl]sfn|Nixon Library, President[/tpl] He appealed to what he later called the "silent majority" of socially conservative Americans who disliked the hippie counterculture and the anti-war demonstrators. Agnew became an increasingly vocal critic of these groups, solidifying Nixon's position with the right.[tpl]sfn|Morrow|1996-09-30[/tpl]
Nixon waged a prominent television advertising campaign, meeting with supporters in front of cameras.[tpl]sfn|Black|pp=513–514[/tpl] He stressed that the crime rate was too high, and attacked what he perceived as a surrender by the Democrats of the United States' nuclear superiority.[tpl]sfn|Black|p=550[/tpl] Nixon promised "peace with honor" in the Vietnam War and proclaimed that "new leadership will end the war and win the peace in the Pacific".[tpl]sfn|Schulzinger|p=413[/tpl] He did not release specifics of how he hoped to end the war, resulting in media intimations that he must have a "secret plan".[tpl]sfn|Schulzinger|p=413[/tpl] His slogan of "Nixon's the One" proved to be effective.[tpl]sfn|Black|pp=513–514[/tpl]
Johnson's negotiators hoped to reach a truce in Vietnam prior to the  election.  Nixon received astute analysis on the talks from Henry Kissinger, then a consultant to U.S. negotiator Averill Harriman, and his campaign was in regular contact with Anna Chennault in Saigon. She advised South Vietnamese president Thieu not to go to Paris to join the talks, hinting that Nixon would give him a better deal if elected.  Johnson was aware of what was going on, as he had both Chennault and the South Vietnamese ambassador to Washington bugged, and was enraged by what he considered an attempt by Nixon to undermine U.S. foreign policy. On October 31, with no agreement, Johnson announced a unilateral halt to the bombing, and that peace negotiations would start in Paris on November 6, the day after Election Day.  On November 2, after speaking with Chennault again, Thieu stated he would not go to Paris. Johnson telephoned Nixon, who denied any involvement; the President did not believe him. Johnson felt he could not publicly mention Chennault's involvement, which had been obtained by wiretapping, but told Humphrey, who chose not to use the information.[tpl]sfn|Langguth|pp=524–527[/tpl]
In a three-way race between Nixon, Humphrey, and independent candidate Alabama Governor George Wallace, Nixon defeated Humphrey by nearly 500,000 votes (seven-tenths of a percentage point), with 301 electoral votes to 191 for Humphrey and 46 for Wallace.[tpl]sfn|Nixon Library, President[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Black|p=558[/tpl] In his victory speech, Nixon pledged that his administration would try to bring the divided nation together.[tpl]sfn|Evans & Novak|pp=33–34[/tpl] Nixon said: "I have received a very gracious message from the Vice President, congratulating me for winning the election. I congratulated him for his gallant and courageous fight against great odds. I also told him that I know exactly how he felt. I know how it feels to lose a close one."[tpl]sfn|UPI 1968 in Review[/tpl]

==Presidency (1969–74)==

Nixon was inaugurated as president on January 20, 1969, sworn in by his onetime political rival, Chief Justice Earl Warren. Pat Nixon held the family Bibles open at Isaiah 2:4, which reads, "They shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks." In his inaugural address, which received almost uniformly positive reviews, Nixon remarked that "the greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker"[tpl]sfn|Black|pp=567–68[/tpl]—a phrase that would later be placed on his gravestone.[tpl]sfn|Frick|p=189[/tpl] He spoke about turning partisan politics into a new age of unity:

===Foreign policy===

====China====

Nixon laid the groundwork for his overture to China even before he became president, writing in Foreign Affairs a year before his election: "There is no place on this small planet for a billion of its potentially most able people to live in angry isolation."[tpl]sfn|Miller Center[/tpl] Assisting him in this venture was his National Security Advisor and future Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, with whom the President worked closely, bypassing Cabinet officials. With relations between the Soviet Union and China at a nadir—border clashes between the two took place during Nixon's first year in office—Nixon sent private word to the Chinese that he desired closer relations. A breakthrough came in early 1971, when Chairman Mao invited a team of American table tennis players to visit China and play against top Chinese players. Nixon followed up by sending Kissinger to China for clandestine meetings with Chinese officials.[tpl]sfn|Miller Center[/tpl] On July 15, 1971, it was simultaneously announced by Beijing and by Nixon (on television and radio) that the President would visit China the following February. The announcements astounded the world.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1989|p=453[/tpl] The secrecy allowed both sets of leaders time to prepare the political climate in their countries for the contact.[tpl]r|Goh-Small[/tpl]
In February 1972, Nixon and his wife traveled to China. Kissinger briefed Nixon for over 40 hours in preparation.[tpl]sfn|Black|p=778[/tpl] Upon touching down, the President and First Lady emerged from Air Force One and greeted Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai. Nixon made a point of shaking Zhou's hand, something which then-Secretary of State John Foster Dulles had refused to do in 1954 when the two met in Geneva.[tpl]sfn|PBS, The Nixon Visit[/tpl] Over 100 television journalists accompanied the president. On Nixon's orders, television was strongly favored over printed publications, as Nixon felt that the medium would capture the visit much better than print. It also gave him the opportunity to snub the print journalists he despised.[tpl]sfn|PBS, The Nixon Visit[/tpl]
Nixon and Kissinger met for an hour with Mao and Zhou at Mao's official private residence, where they discussed a range of issues.[tpl]sfn|Black|pp=780–782[/tpl] Mao later told his doctor that he had been impressed by Nixon, whom he considered forthright, unlike the leftists and the Soviets.[tpl]sfn|Black|pp=780–782[/tpl] He said he was suspicious of Kissinger,[tpl]sfn|Black|pp=780–782[/tpl] though the National Security Advisor referred to their meeting as his "encounter with history".[tpl]sfn|PBS, The Nixon Visit[/tpl] A formal banquet welcoming the presidential party was given that evening in the Great Hall of the People. The following day, Nixon met with Zhou; the joint communique following this meeting recognized Taiwan as a part of China, and looked forward to a peaceful solution to the problem of reunification.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1989|p=516[/tpl] When not in meetings, Nixon toured architectural wonders including the Forbidden City, Ming Tombs, and the Great Wall.[tpl]sfn|PBS, The Nixon Visit[/tpl] Americans received their first glimpse into Chinese life through the cameras which accompanied Pat Nixon, who toured the city of Beijing and visited communes, schools, factories, and hospitals.[tpl]sfn|PBS, The Nixon Visit[/tpl]
The visit ushered in a new era of Sino-American relations.[tpl]sfn|Nixon Library, President[/tpl] Fearing the possibility of a Sino-American alliance, the Soviet Union yielded to pressure for détente with the United States.[tpl]sfn|Dallek|p=300[/tpl]

====Vietnam War====

When Nixon took office, about 300 American soldiers were dying each week in Vietnam,[tpl]cite web | url = http://www.americanwarlibrary.com/vietnam/vwc24.htm | title = Vietnam War Deaths and Casualties By Month | accessdate = June 22, 2012 | publisher = The American War Library[/tpl] and the war was broadly unpopular in the United States, with violent protests against the war ongoing. The Johnson administration had agreed to suspend bombing in exchange for negotiations without preconditions, but this agreement never fully took force. According to Walter Isaacson, soon after taking office, Nixon had concluded that the Vietnam War could not be won and he was determined to end the war quickly.[tpl]sfn|Drew|p=65[/tpl] Conversely, Black argues that Nixon sincerely believed he could intimidate North Vietnam through the "Madman theory".[tpl]sfn|Black|p=572, 1055:  "Nixon, so often a pessimist, thought he could end the Vietnam war within a year....He somehow imagined he could partly replicate Eisenhower's peace in Korea."[/tpl]  Nixon sought some arrangement which would permit American forces to withdraw, while leaving South Vietnam secure against attack.[tpl]sfn|Black|p=569[/tpl]
Nixon approved a secret bombing campaign of North Vietnamese and allied Khmer Rouge positions in Cambodia in March 1969 (code-named Operation Menu),[tpl]sfn|Black|p=591[/tpl] a policy begun under Johnson.[tpl]sfn|Kiernan & Owen[/tpl] These operations resulted in heavy bombing of Cambodia; by one measurement more bombs were dropped over Cambodia under Johnson and Nixon than the Allies dropped during World War II.[tpl]sfn|Kiernan & Owen[/tpl]  In mid-1969, Nixon began efforts to negotiate peace with the North Vietnamese, sending a personal letter to North Vietnamese leaders, and peace talks began in Paris. Initial talks, however, did not result in an agreement.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1989|pp=281–283[/tpl] In May 1969 he publicly proposed to withdraw all American troops from South Vietnam provided North Vietnam also did so and for South Vietnam to hold internationally supervised elections with Viet Cong participation.Address to the Nation on Vietnam May 14, 1969
In July 1969, Nixon visited South Vietnam, where he met with his U.S. military commanders and President Nguyen Van Thieu. Amid protests at home demanding an immediate pullout, he implemented a strategy of replacing American troops with Vietnamese troops, known as "Vietnamization".[tpl]sfn|Nixon Library, President[/tpl] He soon instituted phased U.S. troop withdrawals[tpl]sfn|Time|1971-04-05[/tpl] but authorized incursions into Laos, in part to interrupt the Ho Chi Minh trail, used to supply North Vietnamese forces, that passed through Laos and Cambodia. Nixon announced the ground invasion of Cambodia to the American public on April 30, 1970.[tpl]sfn|AP/St. Peterburg Independent[/tpl] His responses to protesters included an impromptu, early morning meeting with them at the Lincoln Memorial on May 9, 1970.[tpl]r|Safire pp205–209[/tpl][tpl]sfn|UPI/Beaver County Times|1970-05-09[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Black|pp=675–676[/tpl]  Documents uncovered from the Soviet archives after 1991 reveal that the North Vietnamese attempt to overrun Cambodia in 1970 was launched at the explicit request of the Khmer Rouge and negotiated by Pol Pot's then second in command, Nuon Chea.Dmitry Mosyakov, “The Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese Communists: A History of Their Relations as Told in the Soviet Archives,” in Susan E. Cook, ed., Genocide in Cambodia and Rwanda (Yale Genocide Studies Program Monograph Series No. 1, 2004), p54ff. Available at: www.yale.edu/gsp/publications/Mosyakov.doc "In April–May 1970, many North Vietnamese forces entered Cambodia in response to the call for help addressed to Vietnam not by Pol Pot, but by his deputy Nuon Chea. Nguyen Co Thach recalls: “Nuon Chea has asked for help and we have liberated five provinces of Cambodia in ten days.”" Nixon's campaign promise to curb the war, contrasted with the escalated bombing, led to claims that Nixon had a "credibility gap" on the issue.[tpl]sfn|Time|1971-04-05[/tpl]
In 1971, excerpts from the "Pentagon Papers", which had been leaked by Daniel Ellsberg, were published by The New York Times and The Washington Post. When news of the leak first appeared, Nixon was inclined to do nothing; the Papers, a history of United States' involvement in Vietnam, mostly concerned the lies of prior administrations and contained few real revelations. He was persuaded by Kissinger that the papers were more harmful than they appeared, and the President tried to prevent publication. The Supreme Court eventually ruled for the newspapers.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1989|pp=446–448[/tpl]
As U.S. troop withdrawals continued, conscription was reduced and in 1973 ended; the armed forces became all-volunteer.[tpl]sfn|Evans[/tpl] After years of fighting, the Paris Peace Accords were signed at the beginning of 1973. The agreement implemented a cease fire and allowed for the withdrawal of remaining American troops; however, it did not require the 160,000 North Vietnam Army regulars located in the South to withdraw.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1991|pp=53–55[/tpl] Once American combat support ended, there was a brief truce, before fighting broke out again, this time without American combat involvement. North Vietnam conquered South Vietnam in 1975.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1991|p=473[/tpl]

====Latin American policy====

Nixon had been a firm supporter of Kennedy in the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion and 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis; on taking office he stepped up covert operations against Cuba and its president, Fidel Castro. He maintained close relations with the Cuban-American exile community through his friend, Bebe Rebozo, who often suggested ways of irritating Castro. These activities concerned the Soviets and Cubans, who feared Nixon might attack Cuba and break the understanding between Kennedy and Khrushchev which had ended the missile crisis. In August 1970, the Soviets asked Nixon to reaffirm the understanding; despite his hard line against Castro, Nixon agreed. The process had not yet been completed when the Soviets began expanding their base at the Cuban port of Cienfuegos in October 1970. A minor confrontation ensued, which was concluded with an understanding that the Soviets would not use Cienfuegos for submarines bearing ballistic missiles. The final round of diplomatic notes, reaffirming the 1962 accord, were exchanged in November.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1989|pp=379–383[/tpl]
The election of Marxist candidate Salvador Allende as President of Chile in September 1970 spurred Nixon and Kissinger to pursue a vigorous campaign of covert resistance to Allende,[tpl]cite book|last=Kornbluh|first=Peter|title=The Pinochet File: A Declassified Dossier on Atrocity and Accountability|year=2003|publisher=The New Press|location=New York|isbn=1-56584-936-1[/tpl][tpl]rp|25[/tpl] first designed to convince the Chilean congress to confirm Jorge Alessandri as the winner of the election and then messages to military officers in support of a coup. Other support included strikes organized against Allende and funding for Allende opponents. It was even alleged that "Nixon personally authorized" $700,000 in covert funds to print anti-Allende messages in a prominent Chilean newspaper.[tpl]rp|93[/tpl] Following an extended period of social, political, and economic unrest, General Augusto Pinochet assumed power in a violent coup d'état on September 11, 1973; among the dead was Allende.[tpl]sfn|Black|p=921[/tpl]

====Soviet Union====

Nixon used the improving international environment to address the topic of nuclear peace. Following the announcement of his visit to China, the Nixon administration concluded negotiations for him to visit the Soviet Union. The President and First Lady arrived in Moscow on May 22, 1972 and met with Leonid Brezhnev, the General Secretary of the Communist Party; Alexei Kosygin, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers; and Nikolai Podgorny, the head of state, among other leading Soviet officials.[tpl]sfn|BBC|1972-05-22[/tpl]
Nixon engaged in intense negotiations with Brezhnev.[tpl]sfn|BBC|1972-05-22[/tpl] Out of the summit came agreements for increased trade and two landmark arms control treaties: SALT I, the first comprehensive limitation pact signed by the two superpowers,[tpl]sfn|Nixon Library, President[/tpl] and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which banned the development of systems designed to intercept incoming missiles. Nixon and Brezhnev proclaimed a new era of "peaceful coexistence". A banquet was held that evening at the Kremlin.[tpl]sfn|BBC|1972-05-22[/tpl]
Seeking to foster better relations with the United States, both China and the Soviet Union cut back on their diplomatic support for North Vietnam and advised Hanoi to come to terms militarily.[tpl]sfn|Gaddis|pp=294, 299[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Guan|pp=61, 69, 77–79[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Zhai|p=136[/tpl] Nixon later described his strategy:

Having made considerable progress over the previous two years in US-Soviet relations, Nixon embarked on a second trip to the Soviet Union in 1974.[tpl]sfn|Black|p=963[/tpl] He arrived in Moscow on June 27 to a welcome ceremony, cheering crowds, and a state dinner at the Grand Kremlin Palace that evening.[tpl]sfn|Black|p=963[/tpl] Nixon and Brezhnev met in Yalta, where they discussed a proposed mutual defense pact, détente, and MIRVs. While he considered proposing a comprehensive test-ban treaty, Nixon felt he would not have time as president to complete it.[tpl]sfn|Black|p=963[/tpl] There were no significant breakthroughs in these negotiations.[tpl]sfn|Black|p=963[/tpl]

====Middle Eastern policy====

As part of the Nixon Doctrine that the U.S. would avoid direct combat assistance to allies where possible, instead giving them assistance to defend themselves, the U.S. greatly increased arms sales to the Middle East—particularly Israel, Iran and Saudi Arabia—during the Nixon administration.[tpl]r|Hanhimäki-Small[/tpl] The Nixon administration strongly supported Israel, an American ally in the Middle East, but the support was not unconditional. Nixon believed that Israel should make peace with its Arab neighbors and that the United States should encourage it. The president believed that—except during the Suez Crisis—the U.S. had failed to intervene with Israel, and should use the leverage of the large U.S. military aid to Israel to urge the parties to the negotiating table. However, the Arab-Israeli conflict was not a major focus of Nixon's attention during his first term—for one thing, he felt that no matter what he did, American Jews would oppose his reelection.[tpl]efn|name=Jewish vote[/tpl]
On October 6, 1973, an Arab coalition led by Egypt and Syria, supported with tons of arms and materiel by the Soviet Union, attacked Israel in what was known as the Yom Kippur War. Israel suffered heavy losses and Nixon ordered an airlift to resupply Israeli losses, cutting through inter-departmental squabbles and bureaucracy and taking personal responsibility for any response by Arab nations. More than a week later, by the time the U.S. and Soviet Union began negotiating a truce, Israel had penetrated deep into enemy territory. The truce negotiations rapidly escalated into a superpower crisis; when Israel gained the upper-hand, Egyptian President Sadat requested a joint U.S.-USSR peacekeeping mission, which the U.S. refused. When Soviet Premier Brezhnev threatened to unilaterally enforce any peacekeeping mission militarily, Nixon ordered the U.S. military to DEFCON3,DEFCON DEFense CONdition - United States Nuclear Forces placing all U.S. military personnel and bases on alert for nuclear war. This was the closest that the world had come to nuclear war since the Cuban Missile Crisis. Brezhnev backed down as a result of Nixon's actions.[tpl]sfn|Nixon|1978|p=938-940[/tpl]
Because Israel's victory was largely due to U.S. support, the Arab OPEC nations retaliated by refusing to sell crude oil to the U.S., resulting in the 1973 oil crisis.[tpl]sfn|Black|pp=923–928[/tpl] The embargo caused gasoline shortages and rationing in the United States in late 1973, and was eventually ended by the oil-producing nations as peace in the Middle East took hold.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1991|p=311[/tpl]
After the war, and under Nixon's presidency, the U.S. reestablished relations with Egypt for the first time since 1967. Nixon used the Middle East crisis to restart the stalled Middle East Peace Negotiations; he wrote in a confidential memo to Kissinger on October 20:
 I believe that, beyond a doubt, we are now facing the best opportunity we have had in 15 years to build a lasting peace in the Middle East. I am convinced history will hold us responsible if we let this opportunity slip by... I now consider a permanent Middle East settlement to be the most important final goal to which we must devote ourselves.Tyler, Patrick (2010), p. 161 
Nixon made one of his final international visits as president to the Middle East in June 1974, and became the first President to visit Israel.[tpl]sfn|Black|pp=951–52, 959[/tpl]

===Domestic policy===

====Economy====

At the time Nixon took office in 1969, inflation was at 4.7 percent—its highest rate since the Korean War. The Great Society had been enacted under Johnson, which, together with the Vietnam War costs, was causing large budget deficits. There was little unemployment, but interest rates were at their highest in a century.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1989|pp=225–226[/tpl] Nixon's major economic goal was to reduce inflation; the most obvious means of doing so was to end the war.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1989|pp=225–226[/tpl] This could not be accomplished overnight, and the U.S. economy continued to struggle through 1970, contributing to a lackluster Republican performance in the midterm congressional elections (Democrats controlled both Houses of Congress throughout Nixon's presidency).[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1989|pp=431–432[/tpl] According to political economist Nigel Bowles in his 2011 study of Nixon's economic record, the new president did little to alter Johnson's policies through the first year of his presidency.[tpl]r|Bowles-Small[/tpl]
Nixon was far more interested in foreign affairs than domestic policies, but believed that voters tend to focus on their own financial condition, and that economic conditions were a threat to his reelection. As part of his "New Federalism" views, he proposed grants to the states, but these proposals were for the most part lost in the congressional budget process. However, Nixon gained political credit for advocating them.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1989|pp=431–432[/tpl] In 1970, Congress had granted the President the power to impose wage and price freezes, though the Democratic majorities, knowing Nixon had opposed such controls through his career, did not expect Nixon to actually use the authority.[tpl]r|Bowles-Small[/tpl] With inflation unresolved by August 1971, and an election year looming, Nixon convened a summit of his economic advisers at Camp David. He then announced temporary wage and price controls, allowed the dollar to float against other currencies, and ended the convertibility of the dollar into gold.[tpl]sfn|Aitken|pp=399–400[/tpl] Bowles points out, "by identifying himself with a policy whose purpose was inflation's defeat, Nixon made it difficult for Democratic opponents ... to criticize him. His opponents could offer no alternative policy that was either plausible or believable since the one they favored was one they had designed but which the president had appropriated for himself."[tpl]r|Bowles-Small[/tpl] Nixon's policies dampened inflation through 1972, although their aftereffects contributed to inflation during his second term and into the Ford administration.[tpl]sfn|Aitken|pp=399–400[/tpl]
After he won reelection, Nixon found inflation returning.[tpl]sfn|Hetzel|p=92[/tpl] He reimposed price controls in June 1973. The price controls became unpopular with the public and businesspeople, who saw powerful labor unions as preferable to the price board bureaucracy.[tpl]sfn|Hetzel|p=92[/tpl] The controls produced food shortages, as meat disappeared from grocery stores and farmers drowned chickens rather than sell them at a loss.[tpl]sfn|Hetzel|p=92[/tpl] Despite the failure to control inflation, controls were slowly ended, and on April 30, 1974, their statutory authorization lapsed.[tpl]sfn|Hetzel|p=92[/tpl]

====Governmental initiatives and organization====

Nixon advocated a "New Federalism", which would devolve power to state and local elected officials, though Congress was hostile to these ideas and enacted few of them.[tpl]sfn|Aitken|p=395[/tpl] He eliminated the Cabinet-level United States Post Office Department, which in 1971 became the government-run United States Postal Service.[tpl]sfn|USPS, Periodicals postage[/tpl]
Nixon was a late convert to the conservation movement. Environmental policy had not been a significant issue in the 1968 election; the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject. He saw that the first Earth Day in April 1970 presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject, and sought to use that to his benefit; in June he announced the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Nixon broke new ground by discussing environment policy in his State of the Union speech; other initiatives supported by Nixon included the Clean Air Act of 1970 and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA); the National Environmental Policy Act required environmental impact statements for many Federal projects.[tpl]sfn|Aitken|pp=397–398[/tpl] Nixon vetoed the Clean Water Act of 1972—objecting not to the policy goals of the legislation but to the amount of money to be spent on them, which he deemed excessive. After Congress overrode his veto, Nixon impounded the funds he deemed unjustifiable.[tpl]sfn|Aitken|p=396[/tpl]
In 1971, Nixon proposed health insurance reform—a private health insurance employer mandate,[tpl]efn|name=voluntary|voluntary for employees[/tpl] federalization of Medicaid for poor families with dependent minor children,[tpl]sfn|NHI: CQ Almanac 1971[/tpl] and support for health maintenance organizations (HMOs).[tpl]sfn|HMO: CQ Almanac 1973[/tpl] A limited HMO bill was enacted in 1973.[tpl]sfn|HMO: CQ Almanac 1973[/tpl] In 1974, Nixon proposed more comprehensive health insurance reform—a private health insurance employer mandate[tpl]efn|name=voluntary|voluntary for employees[/tpl] and replacement of Medicaid by state-run health insurance plans available to all, with income-based premiums and cost sharing.[tpl]sfn|NHI: CQ Almanac 1974[/tpl]
Concerned about the prevalence of drug use both domestically and among American soldiers in Vietnam, Nixon called for a War on Drugs, pledging to cut off sources of supply abroad, and to increase funds for education and for rehabilitation facilities.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1989|p=418[/tpl]
As one policy initiative, Nixon called for more money for sickle cell research, treatment, and education in February 1971[tpl]sfn|Office of the Federal Register|pp=179–182[/tpl] and signed the National Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act on May 16, 1972.[tpl]sfn|The American Presidency Project[/tpl][tpl]sfn|National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute|p=2[/tpl][tpl]efn|see especially page 2 (after introductory material) in which a bar graph displays NHLBI funding for sickle cell research from FY 1972 through FY 2001, totaling $923 million for these thirty years, starting at $10 million for 1972, then about $15 million a year through 1976, about $20 million for 1977, etc[/tpl]  However, one writer on sickle cell states that while Nixon called for increased spending on such high-profile items as cancer and sickle cell, at the same time he sought to reduce overall spending at the National Institutes of Health as part of his general conservative approach to government.[tpl]sfn|Wailoo|pp=165 & 170[/tpl]

====Civil rights====

The Nixon years witnessed the first large-scale integration of public schools in the South.[tpl]sfn|Boger|p=6[/tpl] Nixon sought a middle way between the segregationist Wallace and liberal Democrats, whose support of integration was alienating some Southern whites.[tpl]sfn|Sabia[/tpl] Hopeful of doing well in the South in 1972, he sought to dispose of desegregation as a political issue before then. Soon after his inauguration, he appointed Vice President Agnew to lead a task force, which worked with local leaders—both white and black—to determine how to integrate local schools. Agnew had little interest in the work, and most of it was done by Labor Secretary George Shultz. Federal aid was available, and a meeting with President Nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees. By September 1970, less than ten percent of black children were attending segregated schools. By 1971, however, tensions over desegregation surfaced in Northern cities, with angry protests over the busing of children to schools outside their neighborhood to achieve racial balance. Nixon opposed busing personally but enforced court orders requiring its use.[tpl]sfn|Parmet|pp=595–597, 603[/tpl]
In addition to desegregating public schools, Nixon implemented the Philadelphia Plan in 1970—the first significant federal affirmative action program.[tpl]sfn|Delaney|1970-07-20[/tpl] He also endorsed the Equal Rights Amendment after it passed both houses of Congress in 1972 and went to the states for ratification.[tpl]sfn|Frum|p=246[/tpl] Nixon had campaigned as an ERA supporter in 1968, though feminists criticized him for doing little to help the ERA or their cause after his election. Nevertheless, he appointed more women to administration positions than Lyndon Johnson had.[tpl]sfn|PBS, Nixon, Domestic Politics[/tpl]

===Space policy===

After a nearly decade-long national effort, the United States won the race to land astronauts on the Moon on July 20, 1969, with the flight of Apollo 11. Nixon spoke with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin during their moonwalk. He called the conversation "the most historic phone call ever made from the White House".[tpl]sfn|Parmet|p=563[/tpl] Nixon, however, was unwilling to keep funding for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) at the high level seen through the 1960s as NASA prepared to send men to the Moon. NASA Administrator Thomas O. Paine drew up ambitious plans for the establishment of a permanent base on the Moon by the end of the 1970s and the launch of a manned expedition to Mars as early as 1981. Nixon, however, rejected both proposals.[tpl]sfn|Handlin[/tpl]
Nixon also canceled the Air Force Manned Orbital Laboratory program in 1969, because unmanned spy satellites were shown to be a more cost-effective way to achieve the same reconnaissance objective.[tpl]sfn|Hepplewhite|pp=204-205|loc=ch. 5[/tpl]
On May 24, 1972, Nixon approved a five-year cooperative program between NASA and the Soviet space program, culminating in the 1975 joint mission of an American Apollo and Soviet Soyuz spacecraft linking in space.[tpl]sfn|Ezell|p=192|loc=ch. 6–11[/tpl]

===Reelection, Watergate scandal, and resignation===

====1972 presidential campaign====

Nixon believed his rise to power had peaked at a moment of political realignment. The Democratic "Solid South" had long been a source of frustration to Republican ambitions. Goldwater had won several Southern states by opposing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 but had alienated more moderate Southerners. Nixon's efforts to gain Southern support in 1968 were diluted by Wallace's candidacy. Through his first term, he pursued a Southern Strategy with policies, such as his desegregation plans, that would be broadly acceptable among Southern whites, encouraging them to realign with the Republicans in the aftermath of the Civil Rights era. He nominated two Southern conservatives, Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell to the Supreme Court, but neither was confirmed by the Senate.[tpl]r|Mason-Small[/tpl]
Nixon entered his name on the New Hampshire primary ballot on January 5, 1972, effectively announcing his candidacy for reelection.[tpl]sfn|Black|p=766[/tpl] Virtually assured the Republican nomination,[tpl]sfn|Black|p=795[/tpl] the President had initially expected his Democratic opponent to be Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy (brother of the late president), but he was largely removed from contention after the 1969 Chappaquiddick incident.[tpl]sfn|Black|p=617[/tpl] Instead, Maine Senator Edmund Muskie became the front runner, with South Dakota Senator George McGovern in a close second place.[tpl]sfn|Black|p=766[/tpl]
On June 10, McGovern won the California primary and secured the Democratic nomination.[tpl]sfn|Black|p=816[/tpl] The following month, Nixon was renominated at the 1972 Republican National Convention. He dismissed the Democratic platform as cowardly and divisive.[tpl]sfn|Black|p=834[/tpl] McGovern intended to sharply reduce defense spending[tpl]sfn|White|p=123[/tpl] and supported amnesty for draft evaders as well as abortion rights. With some of his supporters believed to be in favor of drug legalization, McGovern was perceived as standing for "amnesty, abortion and acid". McGovern was also damaged by his vacillating support for his original running mate, Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton, dumped from the ticket following revelations that he had received treatment for depression.[tpl]sfn|Time|1972-08-14[/tpl][tpl]sfn|Time|1970-11-20[/tpl] Nixon was ahead in most polls for the entire election cycle, and was reelected on November 7, 1972 in one of the largest landslide election victories in American history. He defeated McGovern with over 60 percent of the popular vote, losing only in Massachusetts and the District of Columbia.[tpl]sfn|Parmet|p=629[/tpl]

====Watergate====

The term Watergate has come to encompass an array of clandestine and often illegal activities undertaken by members of the Nixon administration. Those activities included "dirty tricks," or bugging the offices of political opponents and the harassment of activist groups and political figures. The activities were brought to light after five men were caught breaking into Democratic party headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C. on June 17, 1972. The Washington Post picked up on the story; reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward relied on an informant known as "Deep Throat"—later revealed to be Mark Felt, associate director at the FBI—to link the men to the Nixon administration. Nixon downplayed the scandal as mere politics, calling news articles biased and misleading. A series of revelations made it clear that the Committee to Re-elect President Nixon, and later the White House, was involved in attempts to sabotage the Democrats. Senior aides such as White House Counsel John Dean faced prosecution; in total 48 officials were convicted of wrongdoing.[tpl]sfn|Nixon Library, President[/tpl][tpl]sfn|The Washington Post, The Post Investigates[/tpl][tpl]sfn|The Washington Post, The Government Acts[/tpl]
In July 1973, White House aide Alexander Butterfield testified under oath to Congress that Nixon had a secret taping system that recorded his conversations and phone calls in the Oval Office. These tapes were subpoenaed by Watergate Special Counsel Archibald Cox; Nixon provided transcripts of the conversations but not the actual tapes, citing executive privilege. With the White House and Cox at loggerheads, Nixon had Cox fired in October in the "Saturday Night Massacre"; he was replaced by Leon Jaworski. In November, Nixon's lawyers revealed that an audio tape of conversations, held in the White House on June 20, 1972, featured an 18½ minute gap.[tpl]sfn|The Washington Post, The Government Acts[/tpl] Rose Mary Woods, the President's personal secretary, claimed responsibility for the gap, alleging that she had accidentally wiped the section while transcribing the tape, though her tale was widely mocked. The gap, while not conclusive proof of wrongdoing by the President, cast doubt on Nixon's statement that he had been unaware of the cover-up.[tpl]sfn|Aitken|pp=511–512[/tpl]
Though Nixon lost much popular support, even from his own party, he rejected accusations of wrongdoing and vowed to stay in office.[tpl]sfn|The Washington Post, The Government Acts[/tpl] He insisted that he had made mistakes, but had no prior knowledge of the burglary, did not break any laws, and did not learn of the cover-up until early 1973.[tpl]sfn|The Washington Post, Nixon Resigns[/tpl] On October 10, 1973, Vice President Agnew resigned —unrelated to Watergate— and was convicted on charges of bribery, tax evasion and money laundering during his tenure as Governor of Maryland. Nixon chose Gerald Ford, Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, to replace Agnew.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1989|pp=231–232, 239[/tpl]
On November 17, 1973, during a televised question and answer session with the press,[tpl]sfn|Frum|p=26[/tpl] Nixon said,

The legal battle over the tapes continued through early 1974, and in April 1974 Nixon announced the release of 1,200 pages of transcripts of White House conversations between him and his aides. The House Judiciary Committee opened impeachment hearings against the President on May 9, 1974, which were televised on the major TV networks. These hearings culminated in votes for impeachment.[tpl]sfn|The Washington Post, Nixon Resigns[/tpl] On July 24, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the full tapes, not just selected transcripts, must be released.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1991|pp=394–395[/tpl]
The scandal grew to involve a slew of additional allegations against the President, ranging from the proper use of government agencies to accepting gifts in office and his personal finances and taxes; Nixon repeatedly stated his willingness to pay any outstanding taxes due, and paid $465,000 in back taxes in 1974.[tpl]sfn|Samson[/tpl]
Even with support diminished by the continuing series of revelations, Nixon hoped to fight the charges. However, one of the new tapes, recorded soon after the break-in, demonstrated that Nixon had been told of the White House connection to the Watergate burglaries soon after they took place, and had approved plans to thwart the investigation. In a statement accompanying the release of what became known as the "Smoking Gun Tape" on August 5, 1974, Nixon accepted blame for misleading the country about when he had been told of White House involvement, stating that he had a lapse of memory.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1991|pp=414–416[/tpl] He met with Republican congressional leaders soon after, and was told he faced certain impeachment in the House and had, at most, only 15 votes in his favor in the Senate— far fewer than the 34 he needed to avoid removal from office.[tpl]sfn|Black|p=978[/tpl]

====Resignation [tpl]anchor|Resignation of Richard Nixon[/tpl]====

In light of his loss of political support and the near-certainty of impeachment, Nixon resigned the office of the presidency on August 9, 1974, after addressing the nation on television the previous evening.[tpl]sfn|The Washington Post, Nixon Resigns[/tpl] The resignation speech was delivered from the Oval Office and was carried live on radio and television. Nixon stated that he was resigning for the good of the country and asked the nation to support the new president, Gerald Ford. Nixon went on to review the accomplishments of his presidency, especially in foreign policy.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1991|pp=435–436[/tpl] He defended his record as president, quoting from Theodore Roosevelt's 1910 speech Citizenship in a Republic:

Nixon's speech received generally favorable initial responses from network commentators, with only Roger Mudd of CBS stating that Nixon had not admitted wrongdoing.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1991|p=437[/tpl] It was termed "a masterpiece" by Conrad Black, one of his biographers. Black opined that "What was intended to be an unprecedented humiliation for any American president, Nixon converted into a virtual parliamentary acknowledgement of almost blameless insufficiency of legislative support to continue. He left while devoting half his address to a recitation of his accomplishments in office."[tpl]sfn|Black|p=983[/tpl] 

==Later years and death==

===Pardon and illness===

Following his resignation, the Nixons flew to their home La Casa Pacifica in San Clemente, California.[tpl]sfn|Nixon Library, Post Presidency[/tpl] According to his biographer, Aitken, after his resignation, "Nixon was a soul in torment".[tpl]sfn|Aitken|p=529[/tpl] Congress had funded Nixon's transition costs, including some salary expenses, though reducing the appropriation from $850,000 to $200,000. With some of his staff still with him, Nixon was at his desk by 7 a.m.—with little to do.[tpl]sfn|Aitken|p=529[/tpl] His former press secretary, Ron Ziegler, sat with him alone for hours each day.[tpl]sfn|Aitken|pp=529–530[/tpl]
Nixon's resignation had not put an end to the desire among many to see him punished. The Ford White House considered a pardon of Nixon, though it would be unpopular in the country. Nixon, contacted by Ford emissaries, was initially reluctant to accept the pardon, but then agreed to do so. Ford, however, insisted on a statement of contrition; Nixon felt he had not committed any crimes and should not have to issue such a document. Ford eventually agreed, and on September 8, 1974, he granted Nixon a "full, free, and absolute pardon", which ended any possibility of an indictment. Nixon then released a statement:

In October 1974, Nixon fell ill with phlebitis. Told by his doctors that he could either be operated on or die, a reluctant Nixon chose surgery, and President Ford visited him in the hospital. Nixon was under subpoena for the trial of three of his former aides—Dean, Haldeman, and John Ehrlichman—and The Washington Post, disbelieving his illness, printed a cartoon showing Nixon with a cast on the "wrong foot". Judge John Sirica excused Nixon's presence despite the defendants' objections.[tpl]sfn|Aitken|pp=533–534[/tpl] Congress instructed Ford to retain Nixon's presidential papers—beginning a three-decade legal battle over the documents that was eventually won by the former president and his estate.[tpl]sfn|Black|pp=994, 999[/tpl] Nixon was in the hospital when the 1974 midterm elections were held, and Watergate and the pardon were contributing factors to the Republican loss of 43 seats in the House and three in the Senate.[tpl]sfn|Black|p=998[/tpl]

===Return to public life===

In December 1974, Nixon began planning his comeback despite the considerable ill-will against him in the country. He wrote in his diary, referring to himself and Pat,

By early 1975, Nixon's health was improving. He maintained an office in a Coast Guard station 300 yards from his home, at first taking a golf cart and later walking the route each day; he mainly worked on his memoirs.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1991|p=481[/tpl] He had hoped to wait before writing his memoirs; the fact that his assets were being eaten away by expenses and lawyer fees compelled him to begin work quickly.[tpl]sfn|Aitken|pp=537, 539[/tpl] He was handicapped in this work by the end of his transition allowance in February, which compelled him to part with much of his staff, including Ziegler.[tpl]sfn|Black|p=1000[/tpl] In August of that year, he met with British talk-show host and producer David Frost, who paid him $600,000 for a series of sit-down interviews, filmed and aired in 1977.[tpl]sfn|Black|p=1004[/tpl] They began on the topic of foreign policy, recounting the leaders he had known, but the most remembered section of the interviews was that on Watergate. Nixon admitted that he had "let down the country" and that "I brought myself down. I gave them a sword and they stuck it in. And they twisted it with relish. And, I guess, if I'd been in their position, I'd have done the same thing."[tpl]sfn|Drew|p=138[/tpl] The interviews garnered 45–50 million viewers—becoming the most-watched program of their kind in television history.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1991|p=512[/tpl]
The interviews helped improve Nixon's financial position—at one point in early 1975 he had only $500 in the bank—as did the sale of his Key Biscayne property to a trust set up by wealthy Nixon friends such as Bebe Rebozo.[tpl]sfn|Aitken|pp=539–540[/tpl] In February 1976, Nixon visited China at the personal invitation of Mao. Nixon had wanted to return to China, but chose to wait until after Ford's own visit in 1975.[tpl]sfn|Black|p=1005[/tpl] Nixon remained neutral in the close 1976 primary battle between Ford and Reagan. Ford won, but was defeated by Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter in the general election. The Carter administration had little use for Nixon and blocked his planned trip to Australia, causing the government of Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser to withhold its official invitation.[tpl]sfn|Aitken|p=543[/tpl]
In 1976 Nixon was disbarred in the state of New York for obstruction of justice in the Watergate affair. Nixon chose not to present any defense."Nixon disbarred in New York in 1st ruling of Watergate guilt",Toledo Blade, July 9, 1976 p.1
In early 1978, Nixon went to the United Kingdom. He was shunned by American diplomats and by most ministers of the James Callaghan government. He was welcomed, however, by the Leader of the Opposition, Margaret Thatcher, as well as by former prime ministers Lord Home and Sir Harold Wilson, though two other former prime ministers, Harold Macmillan and Edward Heath declined to meet him. Nixon addressed the Oxford Union regarding Watergate:

===Author and elder statesman===

In 1978, Nixon published his memoirs, RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon, the first of ten books he was to author in his retirement.[tpl]sfn|Nixon Library, Post Presidency[/tpl] The book was a bestseller and attracted a generally positive critical response.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1991|p=525[/tpl] Nixon journeyed to the White House in 1979, invited by Carter for the state dinner for Chinese Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping. Carter had not wanted to invite Nixon, but Deng had stated he would visit Nixon in California if the former president was not invited. Nixon had a private meeting with Deng and visited Beijing again in mid-1979.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1991|pp=524–525[/tpl]
On August 10, 1979, the Nixons purchased a New York City townhouse at 817 Fifth AvenuePittsburgh Post-Gazette - Google News Archive Search after being rejected by two Manhattan co-ops.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1991|p=528[/tpl] When the former Shah of Iran died in Egypt in July 1980, Nixon defied the State Department, which intended to send no U.S. representative, by attending the funeral. Though Nixon had no official credentials, as a former president he was seen as the American presence at its former ally's funeral.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1991|p=533[/tpl] Nixon supported Ronald Reagan for president in 1980, making television appearances portraying himself as, in biographer Stephen Ambrose's words, "the senior statesman above the fray".[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1991|p=534[/tpl] He wrote guest articles for many publications both during the campaign and after Reagan's victory.[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1991|p=540[/tpl] After eighteen months in the New York City townhouse, Nixon and his wife moved in 1981 to Saddle River, New Jersey.[tpl]sfn|Nixon Library, Post Presidency[/tpl]
Throughout the 1980s, Nixon maintained an ambitious schedule of speaking engagements and writing,[tpl]sfn|Nixon Library, Post Presidency[/tpl] traveled, and met with many foreign leaders, especially those of Third World countries. He joined former Presidents Ford and Carter as representatives of the United States at the funeral of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.[tpl]sfn|Nixon Library, Post Presidency[/tpl] On a trip to the Middle East, Nixon made his views known regarding Saudi Arabia and Libya, which attracted significant U.S. media attention; The Washington Post ran stories on Nixon's "rehabilitation".[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1991|p=545[/tpl] Nixon journeyed to the Soviet Union in 1986 and on his return sent President Reagan a lengthy memorandum containing foreign policy suggestions and his personal impressions of Mikhail Gorbachev.[tpl]sfn|Nixon Library, Post Presidency[/tpl] Following this trip, Nixon was ranked in a Gallup poll as one of the ten most admired men in the world.[tpl]sfn|Drew|p=142[/tpl]
In 1986, Nixon addressed a convention of newspaper publishers, impressing his audience with his tour d'horizon of the world.[tpl]sfn|Drew|p=144[/tpl] At the time, political pundit Elizabeth Drew wrote, "Even when he was wrong, Nixon still showed that he knew a great deal and had a capacious memory, as well as the capacity to speak with apparent authority, enough to impress people who had little regard for him in earlier times."[tpl]sfn|Drew|p=144[/tpl] Newsweek ran a story on "Nixon's comeback" with the headline "He's back".[tpl]sfn|Aitken|pp=561–562[/tpl]
On July 19, 1990, the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda, California opened as a private institution with the Nixons in attendance. They were joined by a large crowd of people, including Presidents Ford, Reagan, and George H. W. Bush, as well as their wives, Betty, Nancy, and Barbara.[tpl]sfn|Aitken|pp=565–568[/tpl] In January 1991, the former president founded the Nixon Center (today the Center for the National Interest), a Washington policy think tank and conference center.[tpl]sfn|Black|pp=1045–1046[/tpl]
Pat Nixon died on June 22, 1993, of emphysema and lung cancer. Her funeral services were held on the grounds of the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace. Former President Nixon was distraught throughout the interment and delivered a moving tribute to her inside the library building.[tpl]sfn|Black|pp=1049–1050[/tpl]

===Death and funeral===

Nixon suffered a severe stroke on April 18, 1994, while preparing to eat dinner in his Park Ridge home.[tpl]sfn|Weil & Randolph|1994-04-23[/tpl] A blood clot resulting from his heart condition had formed in his upper heart, broken off, and traveled to his brain. He was taken to New York Hospital–Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan, initially alert but unable to speak or to move his right arm or leg.[tpl]sfn|Weil & Randolph|1994-04-23[/tpl] Damage to the brain caused swelling (cerebral edema), and Nixon slipped into a deep coma. He died at 9:08 p.m. on April 22, 1994, with his daughters at his bedside. He was 81 years old.[tpl]sfn|Weil & Randolph|1994-04-23[/tpl]
Nixon's funeral took place on April 27, 1994. Eulogists at the Nixon Library ceremony included President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, California Governor Pete Wilson, and the Reverend Billy Graham. Also in attendance were former Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and their wives.[tpl]sfn|Black|pp=1051–1053[/tpl]
Richard Nixon is buried beside his wife Pat on the grounds of the Nixon Library. He was survived by his two daughters, Tricia and Julie, and four grandchildren.[tpl]sfn|Weil & Randolph|1994-04-23[/tpl] In keeping with his wishes, his funeral was not a full state funeral, though his body did lie in repose in the Nixon Library lobby from April 26 to the morning of the funeral service.[tpl]sfn|BBC|2004-06-11[/tpl] Mourners waited in line for up to eight hours in chilly, wet weather to pay their respects.[tpl]sfn|The Deseret News|1994-04-27[/tpl] At its peak, the line to pass by Nixon's casket was three miles long with an estimated 42,000 people waiting to pay their respects.[tpl]sfn|Frick|p=206[/tpl]
John F. Stacks of Time magazine said of Nixon shortly after his death, "An outsize energy and determination drove him on to recover and rebuild after every self-created disaster that he faced. To reclaim a respected place in American public life after his resignation, he kept traveling and thinking and talking to the world's leaders ... and by the time Bill Clinton came to the White House in 1993], Nixon had virtually cemented his role as an elder statesman. Clinton, whose wife served on the staff of the committee that voted to impeach Nixon, met openly with him and regularly sought his advice."[tpl]sfn|Stacks|1994-05-02[/tpl] Tom Wicker of The New York Times noted that Nixon had been equalled only by Franklin Roosevelt in being five times nominated on a major party ticket and, quoting Nixon's 1962 farewell speech, wrote, "Richard Nixon's jowly, beard-shadowed face, the ski-jump nose and the widow's peak, the arms upstretched in the V-sign, had been so often pictured and caricatured, his presence had become such a familiar one in the land, he had been so often in the heat of controversy, that it was hard to realize the nation really would not 'have Nixon to kick around anymore'."[tpl]sfn|Wicker|1994-04-24[/tpl] Ambrose said of the reaction to Nixon's death, "To everyone's amazement, except his, he's our beloved elder statesman."[tpl]sfn|Sawhill|2011-02[/tpl]
Upon Nixon's death, almost all of the news coverage mentioned Watergate, but for the most part, the coverage was favorable to the former president. The Dallas Morning News stated, "History ultimately should show that despite his flaws, he was one of our most farsighted chief executives."[tpl]sfn|Frick|pp=205–206[/tpl] This offended some; columnist Russell Baker complained of "a group conspiracy to grant him absolution".[tpl]sfn|Frick|pp=204–205[/tpl] Cartoonist Jeff Koterba of the Omaha World-Herald depicted History before a blank canvas, his subject Nixon, as America looks on eagerly. The artist urges his audience to sit down; the work will take some time to complete, as "this portrait is a little more complicated than most".[tpl]sfn|Frick|p=210[/tpl]

==Legacy==

Historian and political scientist James MacGregor Burns observed of Nixon, "How can one evaluate such an idiosyncratic president, so brilliant and so morally lacking?"[tpl]sfn|Skidmore|p=495[/tpl] Nixon's biographers disagree on how he will be perceived by history. According to Ambrose, "Nixon wanted to be judged by what he accomplished. What he will be remembered for is the nightmare he put the country through in his second term and for his resignation."[tpl]sfn|Ambrose|1991|p=592[/tpl] Irwin Gellman, who chronicled Nixon's congressional career, suggests that "he was remarkable among his congressional peers, a success story in a troubled era, one who steered a sensible anti-Communist course against the excess of McCarthy".[tpl]sfn|Gellman|p=460[/tpl] Aitken feels that "Nixon, both as a man and as a statesman, has been excessively maligned for his faults and inadequately recognised for his virtues. Yet even in a spirit of historical revisionism, no simple verdict is possible."[tpl]sfn|Aitken|p=577[/tpl]
Nixon's Southern Strategy is credited by some historians as causing the South to become a Republican stronghold, though others deem economic factors more important to the change.[tpl]r|Mason-Small[/tpl] Throughout his career, he was instrumental in moving his party away from the control of isolationists, and as a congressman was a persuasive advocate of containing Soviet communism.[tpl]sfn|Black|p=1053[/tpl] According to his biographer, Herbert Parmet, "Nixon's role was to steer the Republican party along a middle course, somewhere between the competitive impulses of the Rockefellers, the Goldwaters, and the Reagans."[tpl]sfn|Parmet|p=viii[/tpl]
Nixon is given credit for his stance on domestic affairs, which resulted in the passage and enforcement of environmental and regulatory legislation. Historian Paul Charles Milazzo in his 2011 paper on Nixon and the environment, points to Nixon's creation of the EPA and his enforcement of legislation such as the 1973 Endangered Species Act, stating that "though unsought and unacknowledged, Richard Nixon's environmental legacy is secure."[tpl]r|Milazzo-Small[/tpl]
Nixon saw his policies regarding Vietnam, China, and the Soviets as key to his place in history.[tpl]r|Hanhimäki-Small[/tpl] George McGovern, Nixon's onetime opponent, commented in 1983, "President Nixon probably had a more practical approach to the two superpowers, China and the Soviet Union, than any other president since World War II ... With the exception of his inexcusable continuation of the war in Vietnam, Nixon really will get high marks in history."[tpl]sfn|Greider|1983-10-10[/tpl] Political scientist Jussi M. Hanhimäki disagrees, saying Nixon's diplomacy was merely a continuation of the Cold War policy of containment, using diplomatic rather than military means.[tpl]r|Hanhimäki-Small[/tpl]
Historian Keith W. Olson has written that Nixon left a negative legacy: fundamental mistrust of government with its roots in Vietnam and Watergate.[tpl]r|Olson-Small[/tpl] During the impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1998, both sides tried to use Nixon and Watergate to their advantage: Republicans suggested that Clinton's misconduct had been comparable to Nixon's, while Democrats contended that Nixon's actions had been far more serious than those of the incumbent.[tpl]sfn|Frick|pp=211–214[/tpl] Another legacy, for a time, was a decrease in the power of the presidency as Congress passed restrictive legislation in the wake of Watergate. Olson suggests that grants of power to George W. Bush in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks restored the president's power.[tpl]r|Olson-Small[/tpl]

==Personality and public image==

Nixon's career was frequently dogged by his persona and the public's perception of it. Editorial cartoonists and comedians often exaggerated his appearance and mannerisms, to the point where the line between the human and the caricature became increasingly blurred. He was often portrayed with unshaven jowls, slumped shoulders, and a furrowed, sweaty brow.[tpl]sfn|Reeves|pp=281–283[/tpl]
Nixon had a complex personality, both very secretive and awkward, yet strikingly reflective about himself. He was inclined to distance himself from people and was formal in all aspects, wearing a coat and tie even when home alone.[tpl]sfn|Drew|p=150[/tpl] Nixon biographer Conrad Black described him as being "driven" though also "uneasy with himself in some ways".[tpl]sfn|Black|p=574[/tpl] According to Black, Nixon "thought that he was doomed to be traduced, double-crossed, unjustly harassed, misunderstood, underappreciated, and subjected to the trials of Job, but that by the application of his mighty will, tenacity, and diligence, he would ultimately prevail".[tpl]sfn|Black|p=700[/tpl] Biographer Elizabeth Drew summarized Nixon as a "smart, talented man, but most peculiar and haunted of presidents".[tpl]sfn|Drew|p=151[/tpl] In his account of the Nixon presidency, author Richard Reeves described Nixon as "a strange man of uncomfortable shyness, who functioned best alone with his thoughts".[tpl]sfn|Reeves|p=12[/tpl] Nixon's presidency was doomed by his personality, Reeves argues: "He assumed the worst in people and he brought out the worst in them ... He clung to the idea of being 'tough'. He thought that was what had brought him to the edge of greatness. But that was what betrayed him. He could not open himself to other men and he could not open himself to greatness."[tpl]sfn|Reeves|p=13[/tpl]
In October 1999, a volume of 1971 White House audio tapes was released that contained statements by Nixon deemed derogatory toward Jews.[tpl]sfn|Lardner & Dobbs[/tpl] In one conversation with H. R. Haldeman, Nixon said that Washington was "full of Jews" and that "most Jews are disloyal," making exceptions for some of his top aides.[tpl]sfn|Noah|1999-10-07[/tpl] He then added, "But, Bob, generally speaking, you can't trust the bastards. They turn on you. Am I wrong or right?"[tpl]sfn|Noah|1999-10-07[/tpl] Elsewhere in the 1971 recordings, Nixon denies being anti-Semitic, saying, "If anybody who's been in this chair ever had reason to be anti-Semitic, I did ... And I'm not, you know what I mean?"[tpl]sfn|Noah|1999-10-07[/tpl]
Nixon believed that putting distance between himself and other people was necessary for him as he advanced in his political career and became president. Even Bebe Rebozo, by some accounts his closest friend, did not call him by his first name. Nixon stated of this, "Even with close friends, I don't believe in letting your hair down, confiding this and that and the other thing—saying, 'Gee, I couldn't sleep' ... I believe you should keep your troubles to yourself. That's just the way I am. Some people are different. Some people think it's good therapy to sit with a close friend and, you know, just spill your guts ... and reveal their inner psyche—whether they were breast-fed or bottle-fed. Not me. No way."[tpl]sfn|Greene[/tpl] When told that most Americans, even at the end of his career, did not feel they knew him, Nixon replied, "Yeah, it's true. And it's not necessary for them to know."[tpl]sfn|Greene[/tpl]

 GUESS TEXT:

CATEGORIES: Art exhibitions in Russia, Soviet Union–United States relations, 1959 in the Soviet Union

The American National Exhibition was held in Sokol'niki Park, Moscow in the summer of 1959.

==Objectives==

The exhibit was sponsored by the American government, and it followed a similar Soviet Exhibit in New York City earlier that year. It featured many displays of the latest "home appliances, fashions, television and hi-fi sets, a model house priced to sell to an 'average' family, farm equipment, 1959 automobiles, boats, sporting equipment and a children’s playground,"The Russian People Can Take a Peek at U.S. Civilization." Saturday Evening Post, August 1, 1959. this exhibit was intended to narrow the gap between the Americans and the Soviets and improve the political relations between them. However, the "exhibition was also a tool of cultural diplomacy against the Soviet Communist Regime"Kushner, Marilyn S. Winter 2002. Exhibiting Art at the American National Exhibition in Moscow, 1959: Domestic Politics and Cultural Diplomacy. Journal of Cold War Studies. 4 no. 1: 6. as the American politicians wanted to demonstrate the advantages of capitalism to the Soviets. This is evident in Vice President Richard Nixon’s speech on the opening night of the Exhibition on July 24, 1959 as he congratulated USSR’s Premier Nikita Khrushchev and the Soviets on their advances in astronomy and rocket science, but quickly returned to focus on the United States' strong points, especially the concept of freedom.Nixon, Richard. Speech: What Freedom Means to Us, July 24, 1959.
The various displays of the exhibit were all successful in promoting the American way of life as superior to the Communist regime and lifestyle. For instance, the model of the modern kitchen was a great attraction for most visitors and even sparked the infamous "Kitchen Debate."
A multi-screen film was presented, "Glimpses of the USA" by Charles and Ray Eames.http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/eames/culture.html

==Controversies==

Controversy ensued within the U.S. State Department concerning certain American artists whose works were to be displayed in the Exhibit. Considering the fact that some of the artists had been linked to communist activities, "a few right-wing publicists and legislators claimed that communist sympathizers were undermining the reputation of the United States."Kushner, Marilyn S. Winter 2002. Exhibiting Art at the American National Exhibition in Moscow, 1959: Domestic Politics and Cultural Diplomacy. Journal of Cold War Studies. 4 no. 1: 7. After an investigation of each of these painters and sculptors, Francis Walter, Chairman of the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC), revealed that thirty-four of the sixty-seven featured artists had been involved in some Communist organization.Kushner, Marilyn S. Winter 2002. Exhibiting Art at the American National Exhibition in Moscow, 1959: Domestic Politics and Cultural Diplomacy. Journal of Cold War Studies. 4 no. 1: 10. The Committee was prepared to remove these works from the Exhibit altogether, yet President Dwight Eisenhower intervened and allowed for them to be displayed as were originally planned. In order to appease the conservatives, he also decided to add several paintings, which dated back to the eighteenth century, to Moscow.Kushner, Marilyn S. Winter 2002. Exhibiting Art at the American National Exhibition in Moscow, 1959: Domestic Politics and Cultural Diplomacy. Journal of Cold War Studies. 4 no. 1: 17.

===Splitnik===

In 1959, the vice president of the Housing and Home Components department at Loewy/Snaith, Andrew Geller was the design supervisor for the exhibition, the "Typical American House," built at the American National Exhibition.  The exhibition home largely replicated a home previously built at 398 Townline Road[ref]
</ref> in [[Commack, New York]], which had been originally designed by Stanley H. Klein for a Long Island-based firm, All-State Properties, headed by developer Herbert Sadkin.<ref name="sadkin">
</ref><ref name="sadkinobit">
</ref> To accommodate visitors to the exhibition, Sadkin hired Loewy's office to modify Klein's floor plan.<ref name="townline"/>  Geller supervised the work, which "split" the house, creating its nickname, "Splitnik," and a way for large numbers of visitors to tour the small house.<ref name="townline"/>
Subsequently, Richard Nixon (then Vice President) and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev on July 24, 1959 began what became known as the Kitchen Debate — a debate over the merits of capitalism vs. socialism, with Khrushchev saying Americans could not afford the luxury represented by the "Typical American House".[ref]
</ref> [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union|Tass]], the Soviet news agency said: ''"There is no more truth in showing this as the typical home of the American worker than, say, in showing the Taj Mahal as the typical home of a Bombay textile worker."''<ref name="townline"/>

==American Exhibit==

The American National Exhibition was the first exhibition of a series of travelling exhibitions American Exhibits from the Embassy of the United States in Moscow.http://www.state.gov/p/eur/ci/rs/c26473.htm
