==Etymology of the name Helsinki==

According to oral tradition recorded in the 17th century, the early settlers in the modern Helsinki area came in the middle of the 13th century from the province of Hälsingland in central Sweden. The Vantaa River was accordingly known locally as Helsingå (‘Helsinge River’), and the parish founded in the 14th century was called the Helsinge Parish.
When the plans to found a town in the vicinity of the modern district of Koskela or Forsby ("village of the rapids") started to materialise in 1548, the new town-to-be began to be called Helsinge fors, ‘the Helsinge rapids’. This name then evolved into Helsingfors, which is today the name of the city in Swedish. The ordinary people called the place Helsinge or Helsing, which evolved into the current Finnish name Helsinki.
The name Helsinki has been used in Finnish official documents and in Finnish language newspapers since 1819, when the Senate of Finland moved to the town and the decrees issued there were dated with Helsinki as the place of issue. This is how the form Helsinki came to be used in the Finnish literary language.

==History==

===Early history===

Helsinki was established as a trading town by King Gustav I of Sweden in 1550 as the town of Helsingfors, which he intended to be a rival to the Hanseatic city of Reval (today known as Tallinn). Little came of the plans as Helsinki remained a tiny town plagued by poverty, wars, and diseases. The plague of 1710 killed the greater part of the inhabitants of Helsinki.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.tabblo.com/studio/stories/view/409531/ |title=Ruttopuisto – Plague Park |publisher=Tabblo.com |accessdate=3 November 2008[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl] The construction of the naval fortress Sveaborg (In Finnish Viapori, today also Suomenlinna) in the 18th century helped improve Helsinki's status, but it was not until Russia defeated Sweden in the Finnish War and annexed Finland as the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland in 1809 that the town began to develop into a substantial city. During the war, Russians besieged the Sveaborg fortress and about one quarter of the town was destroyed in an 1808 fire.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.nba.fi/helsinginarkeologiaa/keskusta_kohteet_1810.htm|title=Vuoden 1808 suurpalo|last=Niukkanen|first=Marianna|coauthors=Heikkinen, Markku|work=Kurkistuksia Helsingin kujille|publisher=National Board of Antiquities|language=Finnish|accessdate=14 July 2013[/tpl]
Czar Alexander I of Russia moved the Finnish capital from Turku to Helsinki in 1812 to reduce Swedish influence in Finland and bring the capital closer to St. Petersburg. Following the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, The Royal Academy of Turku, at the time the country's only university, was also relocated to Helsinki, and eventually became the modern University of Helsinki. The move consolidated the city's new role and helped set it on the path of continuous growth. This transformation is highly apparent in the downtown core, which was rebuilt in neoclassical style to resemble St. Petersburg, mostly to a plan by the German-born architect C. L. Engel. As elsewhere, technological advancements such as railroads and industrialization were key factors behind the city's growth.

===Twentieth century===

Despite the tumultuousness of Finnish history during the first half of the 20th century, Helsinki continued its steady development. A landmark event was the XV Olympic games (1952 Olympic Games) held in Helsinki. Finland's rapid urbanization in the 1970s, occurring late relative to the rest of Europe, tripled the population in the metropolitan area, and the Helsinki Metro subway system was built. The relatively sparse population density of Helsinki and its peculiar structure have often been attributed to the lateness of its growth. [tpl]Citation needed|date=October 2010[/tpl]

==Name==

Helsinki (Finnish pronunciation places stress on the first syllable: [tpl]IPA-fi|ˈhelsiŋki[/tpl]), is used to refer to the city in most languages, but not in Swedish.
The Swedish name [tpl]lang|sv|Helsingfors[/tpl] ([tpl]IPA-sv|hɛlsiŋˈfɔrs|[/tpl] or [tpl]IPA-sv|hɛlsiŋˈfɔʂ|[/tpl]) is the original official name of the city of Helsinki (in the very beginning, spelled Hellssingeforss). The Finnish language form of the name probably originates from Helsinga and similar names used for the river that is currently known as the Vantaa River as documented already in the 14th century. Helsingfors comes from the name of the surrounding parish, Helsinge (source for Finnish Helsinki) and the rapids ([tpl]lang-sv|fors[/tpl]), which flowed through the original village.
Another suggestion is that the name Helsinge may have originated with medieval Swedish settlers who came from Hälsingland in Sweden. Others have proposed that the name derives from the Swedish word helsing, a former version of the word hals (neck), referring to the narrowest part of the river, i.e. the rapids.[tpl]cite web|url=http://veta.yle.fi/svenskfinland/artikel.php?id=23&subject=mellannyland |title=Utbildning & Vetenskap: Svenskfinland |publisher=Veta.yle.fi |accessdate=8 July 2009[/tpl][tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl] Other Scandinavian cities located at this kind of geographical locations were given similar names at the time, such as Helsingør and Helsingborg.
In Helsinki slang the city is nicknamed as either Stadi (from the Swedish word stad, meaning "city") or Hesa (short of Helsinki + slang suffix sa), with Stadi being used to assert that the speaker is native to the city.Ristkari, Maiju: Heinäsorsat Helsingissä. Aku Ankka #44/2013, introduction on page 2. [tpl]lang|sme|Helsset[/tpl] is the Northern Saami name of Helsinki.

==Geography==

Helsinki is spread across a number of bays and peninsulas and over a number of islands. The inner city area occupies a southern peninsula, which is rarely referred to by its actual name Vironniemi. Population density in certain parts of Helsinki's inner city area is very high, reaching [tpl]convert|16494|PD/km2[/tpl] in the district of Kallio, but as a whole Helsinki's population density of [tpl]convert|3050|/km2[/tpl] ranks it as quite sparsely populated in comparison to other European capital cities.[tpl]cite web|title=Geography of Helsinki, Overview of Finland|url=http://www.easyexpat.com/en/guides/finland/helsinki/overview/geography.htm|work=easyexpat.com|accessdate=5 February 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|title=Helsinki — School of Computer Science — SOCS|url=http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/h/Helsinki.htm|work=McGill University|accessdate=5 February 2014[/tpl]  Much of Helsinki outside the inner city area consists of postwar suburbs separated from each other by patches of forest. A narrow, ten-kilometre-long (6 mi) Helsinki Central Park that stretches from the inner city to the northern border of Helsinki is an important recreational area for residents.
Major islands in Helsinki include Seurasaari, Lauttasaari and Korkeasaari – the lattermost being the site of the country's biggest zoo. Other significant islands are the fortress island of Suomenlinna (Sveaborg) and the military island of Santahamina. Pihlajasaari island is a favourite summer spot for gay men and naturists, very much comparable to Fire Island off New York City.

===Urban area===

Helsinki urban area spreads to 10 different municipalities[tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl] and
is considered to be the only metropolis in Finland.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.uudenmaanliitto.fi/files/1090/Uudenmaan_maakuntakaava_selostus.pdf |title=Uudenmaan maakuntakaava selostus |publisher=Helsinki-Uusimaa Region |language=Finnish |format=PDF |accessdate=17 February 2014[/tpl] It has population of 1,159,211, land area of 631,11 km² and population density of 1,836.8 per square kilometre It is by far the biggest and most densely populated area of Finland, 3.7 times bigger than  Tampere.
The Helsinki Metropolitan Area consists of the cities of Helsinki, Espoo, Vantaa and Kauniainen. The Metropolitan Area covers [tpl]convert|745|km2|0|abbr=out[/tpl] and contains a total population of approximately one million. With about 19 per cent of the country's population in just 0.2 per cent of its surface area, the housing density of the area is high by Finnish standards. The Metropolitan Area also has a high concentration of employment: approximately 580,000 jobs. Despite the intensity of land use, the region also has large recreational areas and green spaces.
The Helsinki metropolitan area is the world's northernmost urban area among those with a population of over one million people, and the city is the northernmost capital of an EU member state. Altogether 1.3 million people, approximately one in four Finns, live in the Greater Helsinki area.

===Climate===

Helsinki has a humid continental climate (Köppen: Dfb). Owing to the mitigating influence of the Baltic Sea and Gulf Stream, temperatures in winter are higher than the northern location might suggest, with the average in January and February around [tpl]convert|-5|C|F[/tpl].[tpl]cite web|url=http://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/normal-period-1981-2010 |title=Climatological statistics for the normal period 1971–2000 |publisher=Fmi.fi |accessdate=13 April 2010[/tpl] Temperatures below [tpl]convert|−20|C|F[/tpl] occur normally a week or two in a year. However, because of the latitude, days last 5 hours and 48 minutes around the winter solstice with very low Sun rays, and the cloudy weather at this time of year accentuates the darkness. Conversely, Helsinki enjoys long days in summer, during the summer solstice days last 18 hours and 57 minutes .[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.gaisma.com/en/location/helsinki.html|title=Helsinki, Finland – Sunrise, sunset, dawn and dusk times around the World!|last=Tukiainen|first=Matti|work=Gaisma|accessdate=11 February 2011[/tpl] The average maximum temperature from June to August is around [tpl]convert|19|to|23|C|F[/tpl]. Due to the marine effect, especially in summer daily temperatures are cooler and night temperatures are higher than further away in the mainland.

==Cityscape==

Carl Ludvig Engel (1778–1840) was appointed to design a new city centre all on his own. He designed several neoclassical buildings in Helsinki. The focal point of Engel's city plan is the Senate Square. It is surrounded by the Government Palace (to the east), the main building of Helsinki University (to the west), and (to the north) the enormous Cathedral, which was finished in 1852, twelve years after C. L. Engel's death. Subsequently, Engel's neoclassical plan stimulated the epithet, The White City Of The North. Helsinki is, however, perhaps even more famous for its numerous Art Nouveau (Jugend in Finnish) influenced buildings of the romantic nationalism, designed in the early 1900s and strongly influenced by the Kalevala, which is a very popular theme in the national romantic art of that era. Helsinki's Art Nouveau style is also featured in large residential areas such as Katajanokka and Ullanlinna. The master of the Finnish Art Nouveau was Eliel Saarinen (1873–1950), whose architectural masterpiece was the Helsinki central railway station.
Helsinki also features several buildings by the world-renowned Finnish architect Alvar Aalto (1898–1976), recognized as one of the pioneers of architectural functionalism. However, some of his works, such as the headquarters of the paper company Stora Enso and the concert venue, Finlandia Hall, have been subject to divided opinions from the citizens.[tpl]cite web|url=http://helsinginaallot.blogspot.com/2007/02/stora-enson-pkonttori-kanavaranta-1.html|title=Stora Enson pääkonttori, Kanavaranta 1|date=25 February 2007|work="Helsingin Aallot" blog|language=Finnish|accessdate=5 February 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite news|url=http://www.hs.fi/paakirjoitus/artikkeli/Kohtaako+Enson+konttori+voittajansa/HS20080614SI1MA01re3|title=Kohtaako Enson konttori voittajansa?|at=Lead editorial|date=14 June 2008|newspaper=Helsingin Sanomat|language=Finnish|accessdate=5 February 2011[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www2.hs.fi/extrat/kulttuuri/rakennukset/rakennukset_c2.html|title=Kiasma nousi inhokkien ykköseksi|last=Penttilä|first=Vappu|work=Verkkoliite|publisher=Helsingin Sanomat|language=Finnish|accessdate=5 February 2011[/tpl]
Renowned functionalist buildings in Helsinki by other architects include the Olympic Stadium, the Tennis Palace, the Rowing Stadium, the Swimming Stadium, the Velodrome, the Glass Palace, the Exhibition Hall (now Töölö Sports Hall) and Helsinki-Malmi Airport. The sports venues were built to serve the 1940 Helsinki Olympic Games; the games were initially cancelled due to the Second World War, but the venues eventually got to fulfill their purpose in the 1952 Olympic Games. Many of them are listed by DoCoMoMo as significant examples of modern architecture. The Olympic Stadium and Helsinki-Malmi Airport are in addition catalogued by the National Board of Antiquities as cultural-historical environments of national significance. [tpl]Citation needed|date=January 2010[/tpl]
As a historical footnote, Helsinki's neoclassical buildings were often used as a backdrop for scenes set to take place in the Soviet Union in many Cold War era Hollywood movies, when filming in the USSR was not possible. Some of the more notable ones are The Kremlin Letter (1970), Reds (1981) and Gorky Park (1983). Because some streetscapes were reminiscent of Leningrad's and Moscow's old buildings, they too were used in movie productions—much to some residents' dismay. At the same time the government secretly instructed Finnish officials not to extend assistance to such film projects.Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland, Political Department: [tpl]PDFlink|Memo 56 of 20 January 1982 (labelled highly confidential in 1982)|1.37 MB[/tpl]

==Government==

The city council of Helsinki consists of eighty-five members. Following the most recent municipal election in 2012, the three largest parties are National Coalition (23), Greens (19), and Social Democrats (15).[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.vaalikone.fi/kunta2012/tulos/01/ |title=Helsingin vaalipiiri — Tulospalvelu — Kuntavaalit 2012 |publisher=Vaalikone.fi |accessdate=12 March 2013[/tpl] The mayor, Jussi Pajunen, is a member of the National Coalition Party.
Like in all Finnish municipalities, the City Council of Helsinki is the main decision-making organ in local politics, dealing with issues such as city planning, schools, health care, and public transport. The 85-member council is elected every fourth year by municipal elections.
Traditionally, the conservative National Coalition Party (kokoomus) has been the biggest party in Helsinki's local politics, with the Social Democrats being the second biggest. In the 2000 election the Green League, for which Helsinki is the strongest area of support nationally, gained the position of the second most popular party. In 2004 however, the Social Democrats regained that position. In 2008 election, the Green League again became the second biggest party, and they remained so in the 2012 election.
The Left Alliance is the fourth largest party, while the True Finns have increased their support steadily to become the fifth largest party. The Swedish People's Party's support has been steadily declining over the years, most likely because of the diminishing proportion of Swedish speakers in Helsinki. The Centre Party of Finland, despite being one of the major parties in nationwide politics, only has little support in Helsinki like it does in most other big cities.

==Demographics==

Helsinki has a higher proportion of women (53.4%) than elsewhere in Finland (51.1%). Helsinki's current population density of 2,739.36 people per square kilometer is by far the highest in Finland. Life expectancy for both genders is slightly below the national averages: 75.1 years for men as compared to 75.7 years, 81.7 years for women as compared to 82.5 years.[tpl]cite web| author=Tapani Valkonen ym. | title = Tutkimuksia 10/2007: Elinajanodotteen kehitys Helsingissä ja sen väestönosaryhmissä 1991–2005 | date = 17 December 2007 | url = http://www.hel.fi/hel2/tietokeskus/julkaisut/pdf/07_12_17_tutk_10_Valkonen.pdf | publisher = Helsingin kaupunki, tietokeskus | accessdate = 30 December 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web|author=Tilastolaitoksen historiaa |url=http://www.stat.fi/org/historia/elinajanodote.html |title=Tilasto |publisher=Stat.fi |accessdate=13 April 2010[/tpl]
Helsinki has experienced strong growth since the 1810s, when it replaced Turku as the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland, which later became the sovereign Republic of Finland. The city continued to show strong growth from that time onwards, with the exception during the Finnish Civil War period. From the end of World War II up until the 1970s there was a massive exodus of people from the countryside to the cities of Finland, in particular Helsinki. Between 1944 and 1969 the population of the city nearly doubled from 275,000[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hel.fi/hki/Helsinki/en/Etusivu |title=Helsingin historia |publisher=Hel.fi |accessdate=13 April 2010[/tpl] to 525,600.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.aatos.fi/Hki450v/metro.html |title=Maan alle |publisher=Aatos.fi |date=30 December 1972 |accessdate=13 April 2010[/tpl]
In the 1960s, the population growth of Helsinki proper began to ebb mainly due to lack of housing.[tpl]cite journal|last=Butzin|first=Bernhard|year=1991|title=Helsinki — aspects of urban development and planning|journal=GeoJournal|publisher=Springer, Netherlands|volume=2|issue=1|pages=11–26|issn=0343-2521|accessdate=23 January 2011|doi=10.1007/BF00212573[/tpl] Many residents began to move to neighbouring Espoo and Vantaa, where population growth has since soared.

[tpl]citation needed|date=December 2010[/tpl] Neighboring Vantaa has seen even more dramatic change in the same time span: from 14,976 in 1950 to 197,663 in 2009, a thirteenfold increase.

A minority, at 6.0%, speak Swedish. Around 11.5% of the population speak a native language other than Finnish or Swedish. Helsinki slang combines influences from the Finnish, Swedish and Russian languages. Finnish today is the common language of communication between Finnish speakers, Swedish speakers and speakers of other languages (New Finns) in day-to-day affairs in the public sphere between unknown persons. In case a speaker's knowledge of Finnish is not known, English is usually spoken. Swedish is commonly spoken in city or national agencies specifically aimed at Finland-Swedish speakers, such as the Social Services Department on Hämeentie or the Luckan Cultural centre in Kamppi. Knowledge of Finnish is also essential in business and is usually a basic requirement in the employment market.[tpl]cite web|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/immigrants_learning_swedish_over_finnish_run_into_problems/2114684 |title=Immigrants Learning Swedish over Finnish Run into Problems | News | YLE Uutiset |publisher=yle.fi |accessdate=16 September 2011[/tpl]

===Immigration===

Helsinki is the global gateway of Finland. The city has Finland's largest immigrant population in both absolute and relative terms. There are over 130 nationalities represented in Helsinki. The largest groups are from Russia, Estonia, Sweden, Somalia, Serbia, China, Iraq, Germany and Turkey.
Foreign citizens make up 8.0% of the population, while foreign born make up 11.1%. In 2012, 68,375 residents spoke a native language other than Finnish, Swedish or one of the three Sami languages spoken in Finland. The largest groups of residents with a non-Finnish background come from Russia (14,532), Estonia (9,065) and Somalia (6,845). Half of the immigrant population in Finland lives in greater Helsinki, and one third in the city of Helsinki.[tpl]cite web|author=Katriina Pajari |url=http://metro.fi/paakaupunkiseutu/uutiset/kolmannes_maahanmuuttajista_asuu_helsingissa/ |title=Kolmannes maahanmuuttajista asuu Helsingissä – HS.fi – Kaupunki |publisher=HS.fi |date=7 December 2008 |accessdate=13 April 2010[/tpl]

===Sports===

Helsinki has a long tradition of sports: the city gained much of its initial international recognition during the 1952 Summer Olympics, and the city has arranged sporting events such as the first World Championships in Athletics 1983 and 2005, and the European Championships in Athletics 1971, 1994 and 2012. Helsinki hosts successful local teams in both of the most popular team sports in Finland, football and ice hockey.

The Olympic stadium hosted the first ever Bandy World Championship in 1957.[tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl]
Helsinki was elected host-city of the 1940 Summer Olympics, but due to World War II they were canceled. Instead Helsinki was the host of the 1952 Summer Olympics. The Olympics were a landmark event symbolically and economically for Helsinki and Finland as a whole that was recovering from the winter war and the continuation war fought with the Soviet Union. Helsinki was also in 1983 the first ever city to host the World Championships in Athletics. Helsinki also hosted the event in 2005, thus also becoming the first city to ever host the Championships for a second time. The Helsinki City Marathon has been held in the city every year since 1980, usually in August. A Formula 3000 race through the city streets was held on 25 May 1997. In 2009 Helsinki was host of European Figure Skating Championships.

==Transport==

===Roads===

The backbone of Helsinki's motorway network consists of three semicircular ring roads, Ring I, Ring II, and Ring III, which connect expressways heading to other parts of Finland, and the western and eastern arteries of Länsiväylä and Itäväylä respectively.  While variants of a Keskustatunneli tunnel under the city centre have been repeatedly proposed, as of 2011 the plan remains on the drawing board.
Helsinki has some 390 cars per 1000 inhabitants.[tpl]dead link|date=February 2014[/tpl] This is less than in cities of similar density, such as Brussels' 483 per 1000, Stockholm's 401, and Oslo's 413.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.eaue.de/Promode/Runge.pdf |title=Runge |publisher=European Academy of the Urban Environment |format=PDF |accessdate=17 February 2014[/tpl][tpl]cite web|url=http://www.hel.fi/hel2/tietokeskus/suunnat/ss405/suunnatframe2.html |title=Tietokeskus: suunnatframe |publisher=Hel2.fi |accessdate=8 July 2009[/tpl]

===Rail transport and buses===

Public transport is generally a hotly debated subject in the local politics of Helsinki. In Helsinki metropolitan area, public transportation is managed under Helsinki Region Transport, the metropolitan area transportation authority. The diverse public transport system consists of trams, commuter rail, the subway, bus lines, two ferry lines and on-demand minibuses.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/2013/10/on-demand-public-transit/|title=New Helsinki Bus Line Lets You Choose Your Own Route|last=Barry|first=Keith|date=10 November 2013|publisher=Wired|accessdate=4 April 2014[/tpl]
Today, Helsinki is the only city in Finland to have trams or metro trains. There used to be two other cities in Finland with trams: Turku and Viipuri (Vyborg, now in Russia), but both have since abandoned trams. The Helsinki Metro, opened in 1982, is the only rapid transit system in Finland. In 2006, the construction of the long debated extension of the system west into Espoo was approved, and serious debate about an eastern extension into Sipoo has taken place.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.lansimetro.fi/ |title=Länsimetro rakentaa tulevaisuutta turvallisesti |publisher=Lansimetro.fi |accessdate=17 February 2014[/tpl]
The possibility of a Helsinki to Tallinn Tunnel is currently being researched. The rail tunnel would connect Helsinki to the Estonian capital Tallinn, further linking Helsinki to the rest of continental Europe by Rail Baltica.

===Aviation===

Air traffic is handled primarily from the international Helsinki Airport, located approximately [tpl]convert|19|km|mi|0[/tpl] north of Helsinki's downtown area, in the neighbouring city of Vantaa. Helsinki's second airport, Malmi Airport, is mainly used for general and private aviation. Helicopter flights to Tallinn are available from Hernesaari Heliport.

===Sea transport===

Ferry connections to Tallinn, Mariehamn and Stockholm are serviced by various companies. Finnlines passenger-freight ferries to Gdynia, Poland, Travemünde, Germany and Rostock, Germany are also available. St Peter Line offers passenger ferry service to Saint Petersburg several times a week.
