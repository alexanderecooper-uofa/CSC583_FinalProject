Jordan ([tpl]IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ɔr|d|ə|n[/tpl]; [tpl]lang-ar|[tpl]big|الأردن[/tpl][/tpl] [tpl]transl|ar|ALA|al-Urdun[/tpl]), officially the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan ([tpl]lang-ar|[tpl]big|المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية[/tpl][/tpl] [tpl]transl|ar|ALA|al-Mamlakah al-Urdunīyah al-Hāshimīyah[/tpl]), is an Arab kingdom in Western Asia, on the East Bank of the Jordan River, and extending into the historic region of Palestine. Jordan borders Saudi Arabia to the south and east, Iraq to the north-east, Syria to the north, and Palestine, the Dead Sea and Israel to the west.
The kingdom emerged from the post-World War I division of West Asia by Britain and France. In 1946, Jordan became an independent sovereign state officially known as the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan. After capturing the West Bank during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Abdullah I took the title King of Jordan and Palestine. The name of the state was changed to The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan on 1 December 1948.Howard Sachar, A History of Israel: From the Rise of Zionism to Our Time, Random House LLC, 31 July 2013.
Although Jordan is a constitutional monarchy, the king holds wide executive and legislative powers.

==History==

In antiquity, the present day Jordan became a home for several Semitic Canaanite-speaking ancient kingdoms, including the kingdom of Edom, the kingdom of Moab, the kingdom of Ammon, the kingdom of Israel and also the Amalekites. Throughout different eras of history, the region and its nations were subject to the control of powerful foreign empires; including the Akkadian Empire (2335-2193 BC), Ancient Egypt (15th to 13th centuries BC), Hittite Empire (14th and 13th centuries BC), the Middle Assyrian Empire (1365-1020 BC), Neo-Assyrian Empire (911-605 BC), the Neo-Babylonian Empire (604-539 BC) and the Achaemenid Empire (539-332 BC) and, for discrete periods of times, by Israelites. The Mesha Stele recorded the glory of the King of Moab and the victories over the Israelites and other nations. The Ammon and Moab kingdoms are mentioned in ancient maps, Near Eastern documents, ancient Greco-Roman artifacts, and Christian and Jewish religious scriptures.[tpl]cite web|url=http://www.bibleplaces.com/edom.htm |title=Edom |publisher=BiblePlaces.com |accessdate=15 June 2010[/tpl]

===Classical Transjordan===

Due to its strategic location in the middle of the ancient world, Transjordan came to be controlled by the ancient empires of Persians and later the Macedonian Greeks, who became the dominant force in the region, following the conquests of Alexander the Great. It later fell under the changing influence of the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire from the North and the Parthians from the East.
The Aramaic speaking Nabatean kingdom was one of the most prominent states in the region through the middle classic period, since the decline of the Seleucid control of the region in 168 BC. The Nabateans were most probably people of mixed Aramean, Canaanite and Arabian ancestry, who fell under the early influence of the Hellenistic and Parthian cultures, creating a unique civilized society, which roamed the roads of the deserts. They controlled the regional and international trade routes of the ancient world by dominating a large area southwest of the Fertile Crescent, which included the whole of modern Jordan in addition to the southern part of Syria in the north and the northern part of Arabian Peninsula in the south. The Nabataeans developed the Nabatean Alphabet, a descendant of the Aramaic alphabet, which was eventually to lead to the formation of the Arabic Script in the 4th century AD.^ Jump up to: a b 1, http://www.omniglot.com/writing/nabataean.htm. Their language was originally Aramaic (a West Semitic language), but became infused with South Semitic Arabic with the migration of Arab tribes into Nabatea in the 3rd and 4th centuries AD.^ Basalt, 1st century AD. Found in Sia in the Hauran, Southern Syria. It acted as an intermediary between Aramaean and Classical Arabic, the latter of which evolved into Modern Arabic.
The Nabateans were largely conquered by the Hasmonean rulers of Judea and many of them forced to convert to Judaism in the late 2nd century BC. However, the Nabataeans managed to maintain a sort of semi-independent kingdom, which covered most parts of modern Jordan and beyond, before it was taken by the Herodians and finally annexed by the still expanding Roman Empire in 106 AD. However, apart from Petra, the Romans maintained the prosperity of most of the ancient cities in Transjordan which enjoyed a sort of city-state autonomy under the umbrella of the alliance of the Decapolis. Nabataean civilization left many magnificent archaeological sites at Petra, which is considered one of the New 7 Wonders of the World as well as recognized by the UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.
Following the establishment of Roman Empire at Syria, the country was incorporated into the client Judaean Kingdom of Herod, and later the Judaea Province. With the suppression of Jewish Revolts, the eastern bank of Transjordan was incorporated into the Syria Palaestina province, while the eastern deserts fell under Parthian and later Persian Sassanid control. During the Greco-Roman period, a number of semi-independent city-states also developed in the region of Transjordan under the umbrella of the Decapolis including: Gerasa (Jerash), Philadelphia (Amman), Raphana (Abila), Dion (Capitolias), Gadara (Umm Qais), and Pella (Irbid).
With the decline of the Eastern Roman Empire, Transjordan came to be controlled by the Christian Ghassanid Arab kingdom, which allied with Byzantium. The Byzantine site of Umm ar-Rasas is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

===Middle Ages to World War I===

Due to its proximity to Damascus, Transjordan became in the 7th century a heartland for the Arabic Islamic Empire and therefore secured several centuries of stability and prosperity,[tpl]citation needed|date=May 2012[/tpl] which allowed the coining of its current Arabic Islamic identity. Different Caliphates' stages, including the Rashidun Empire, Umayyad Empire and Abbasid Empire controlled the region. Several resources pointed that the Abbasid movement, was started in region of Transjordan before it took over the Umayyad empire. After the decline of the Abbasid, It was ruled by several conflicting powers including the Mongols, the Crusaders, the Ayyubids and the Mamluks until it became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1516.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/his_ottoman.html |title=Jordan – History – The Ottoman Empire |publisher=The Royal Hashemite Court |accessdate=9 November 2009[/tpl]
The Umayyad caliphs constructed rural estates such as Qasr Mshatta, Qasr al Hallabat, Qasr Kharana, Qasr Tuba, and Qasr Amra. Castles constructed in the later Middle Ages including Ajloun, Al Karak, and Qasr Azraq were used in the Ayyubid, Crusader, and Mamluk eras.
In the 11th century, Transjordan witnessed a phase of instability, as it became a battlefield for the Crusades which ended with defeat by the Ayyubids. Jordan suffered also from the Mongol attacks which were blocked by Mamluks.
In 1516, Transjordan became part of the Ottoman Empire and remained so until 1918, when the Hashemite Army of the Great Arab Revolt took over, and secured the present day Jordan with the help and support of Transjordanian local tribes.
During World War I, the Transjordanian tribes fought, along with other tribes of the Hijaz, the Tihamah, and Levant regions, as part of the Arab Army of the Great Arab Revolt. The revolt was launched by the Hashemites and led by Sherif Hussein of Mecca against the Ottoman Empire. It was supported by the Allies of World War I. The chronicle of the revolt was written by T. E. Lawrence who, as a young British Army officer, played a liaison role during the revolt. He published the chronicle in London, 1922 under the title "Seven Pillars of Wisdom",[tpl]cite book |title=Seven Pillars of Wisdom |author=T. E. Lawrence |year=1922 |place=United Kingdom[/tpl] which was the basis for the iconic movie "Lawrence of Arabia".
The Great Arab Revolt was successful in gaining independence for most of the territories of Hijaz and the Levant, including the region of east of Jordan. However, it failed to gain international recognition of the region as an independent state, due mainly to the secret Sykes–Picot Agreement of 1916 and the Balfour Declaration of 1917.[tpl]Citation needed|date=June 2011[/tpl] This was seen by the Hashemites and the Arabs as betrayal of the previous agreements with the British, including the McMahon–Hussein Correspondence in 1915, in which the British stated their willingness to recognize the independence of the Arab state in Hijaz and the Levant. However, a compromise was eventually reached and the Emirate of Transjordan was created under the reign of the Hashemites.

===British Transjordan mandate===

In September 1922, the Council of the League of Nations recognized Transjordan as a state under the British Mandate and the Transjordan memorandum, and excluded the territories east of the Jordan River from all of the provisions of the mandate dealing with Jewish settlement.League of Nations Official Journal, Nov. 1922, pp. 1188–1189, 1390–1391. The Permanent Court of International Justice and an International Court of Arbitration established by the Council of the League of Nations handed down rulings in 1925 which determined that both a Jewish and an Arab state in the Mandatory regions of Palestine and Transjordan were to be newly created successor states of the Ottoman Empire as defined by international law.Marjorie M. Whiteman, Digest of International Law, vol. 1, U.S. State Department (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1963) pp 650–652 The country remained under British supervision until 1946.
The Hashemite leadership met multiple difficulties upon assuming power in the region. The most serious threats to Emir Abdullah's position in Transjordan were repeated Wahhabi incursions from Najd into southern parts of his territory.[tpl]cite book |author=Kamal S. Salibi |title=The Modern History of Jordan |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7zdi2sCuIh8C&pg=PA104 |accessdate=2013-06-26 |date=1998-12-15 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=978-1-86064-331-6 |page=104[/tpl] The emir was unable to repel those raids without support, so the British maintained a military base, with a small RAF detachment, at Marka, close to Amman. The British force was also used to help the emir (and, subsequently, Sultan Adwan) suppress local rebellions at Kura in 1921 and 1923.

===Independence===

On 25 May 1946, the United Nations approved the end of the British Mandate and recognized Transjordan as an independent sovereign kingdom. The Parliament of Transjordan proclaimed King Abdullah as the first King.
The name was changed from Transjordan to Jordan in 1948. According to the prime minister Tewfik Abul Huda at the time, the name of the kingdom had been changed in 1946. On June 1, 1949, he issued a public notice:
 It is to be remembered that the decision of the Houses of Parliament which was taken on May 25, 1946, and which declared the independence of this country said that the name of this Kingdom is the "Hashemite Kingdom of the Jordan." The Jordan Constitution, published at the beginning of February, 1947, approved this decision. However, it is noticed that the name of "Transjordan" is still applied to this Kingdom, and certain people and official institutions still use the old name in Arabic and foreign languages, which makes me obliged to point out to all who are concerned that the correct and official name which should be officially used in all cases is : Al-Mamlakeh Al-Urdunieh Al-Hashemieh and in English "The
 Hashemite Kingdom of the Jordan."[tpl]cite book | author = Muhammad Khalil | year = 1962 | publisher = Khayats | place = Beirut | pages = 53–54 | title = The Arab States and the Arab League: a Documentary Record[/tpl] translating the Official Gazette, No. 984.
Following the war with Israel in 1948 Jordan occupied the West Bank and on 24 April 1950 Jordan formally annexed these territories, an act that was regarded as illegal and void by the Arab League. The move formed part of Jordan’s "Greater Syria Plan" expansionist policy,[tpl]cite book |author=Naseer Hasan Aruri |title=Jordan: a study in political development (1921–1965) |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GVaG4WGKj9MC&pg=PA90 |accessdate=22 December 2010 |year=1972 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-90-247-1217-5 |page=90 |quote=For Abdullah, the annexation of Palestine was the first step in the implementation of his Greater Syria Plan.

On 20 July 1951, as he was leaving the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, Abdullah I was assassinated by Mustafa Ashu, a Palestinian al-Jihad al-Muqaddas militant. The reason for his murder was, allegedly,[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] the power rivalry of the al-Husseinis over control of Palestine, which Abdullah I had declared a part of the Hashemite Kingdom. Though Amin al-Husseini, the former Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, was not directly charged in the plot, Musa al-Husseini was among the six executed by Jordanian authorities following the assassination.
On 27 July 1953, King Hussein of Jordan announced that East Jerusalem was "the capital of the Hashemite Kingdom" and would form an "integral and inseparable part" of Jordan.[tpl]cite book |author=Martin Gilbert |title=Jerusalem in the Twentieth Century |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hOYUAQAAIAAJ |accessdate=22 December 2010 |date=12 September 1996 |publisher=J. Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-0-471-16308-4 |page=254[/tpl] In 1957, Jordan terminated the Anglo-Jordanian treaty, one year after the king sacked the British personnel serving in the Jordanian Army. This act of Arabization ensured the complete sovereignty of Jordan as a fully independent nation.
In June 1967, having signed a military pact with Egypt the previous month, Jordan joined Egypt, Syria and Iraq in the Six-Day War against Israel. It ended in an Israeli victory and the capture of the West Bank. The period following the war saw an upsurge in the activity and numbers of Palestinian paramilitary elements (fedayeen) within the state of Jordan. These distinct, armed militias were becoming a "state within a state", threatening Jordan's rule of law. King Hussein's armed forces targeted the fedayeen and open fighting erupted in June 1970. The battle in which Palestinian fighters from various Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) groups were expelled from Jordan is commonly known as Black September.
The heaviest fighting occurred in northern Jordan and Amman, during which a Syrian tank force invaded northern Jordan to back the fedayeen fighters but subsequently retreated. King Hussein urgently asked the United States and Great Britain to intervene against Syria. Consequently, Israel performed mock air strikes on the Syrian column at the Americans' request. Soon after, Syrian President Nureddin al-Atassi ordered a hasty retreat from Jordanian soil.[tpl]cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/11/28/nixon.papers/index.html |work=CNN |accessdate=31 March 2010 |title=Jordan asked Nixon to attack Syria, declassified papers show |date=28 November 2007[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.historycentral.com/mideast/BlkSept.html |title=Black September |publisher=History Central |date= |accessdate=2013-01-17[/tpl] By 22 September, Arab foreign ministers meeting in Cairo arranged a cease-fire beginning the following day. However, sporadic violence continued until Jordanian forces, led by Habis Al-Majali, managed to expel the fedayeen in July 1971 with the help of Iraqi forces.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/F8CB417C-1AB0-47B7-9F7D-7EBCFB6D2FC5 |title=[tpl]big|القيادة العامة الفلسطينية كما يراها أحمد جبريل ح8[/tpl] |language=Arabic |publisher=Aljazeera.net |date=2004-05-23 |accessdate=2013-01-17[/tpl] The PLO's Yasser Arafat soon followed.
In 1973, allied Arab League forces attacked Israel in the Yom Kippur War and fighting occurred along the 1967 Jordan River cease-fire line. Jordan sent a brigade to Syria to attack Israeli units on Syrian territory but did not engage Israeli forces from Jordanian territory. At the Rabat summit conference in 1974, Jordan was now in a more secure position to agree, along with the rest of the Arab League, that the PLO was the "sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people", thereby relinquishing Jordan's role as representative of the West Bank to it.
The Amman Agreement of 11 February 1985, declared that the PLO and Jordan would pursue a proposed confederation between the state of Jordan and a Palestinian state.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/4746#fn1 |title=An Interview with Yasser Arafat, Volume 34, Number 10, 11 June 1987 |publisher=New York Review of Books |date= |accessdate=2013-01-17[/tpl] In 1988, King Hussein dissolved the Jordanian parliament and renounced Jordanian claims to the West Bank. The PLO assumed responsibility as the Provisional Government of Palestine and an independent state was declared.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/306128/Jordan/ |title=» Renouncing claims to the West Bank |publisher=Britannica.com |date=1978-06-15 |accessdate=2013-01-17[/tpl]
In 1991, Jordan agreed to participate in direct peace negotiations with Israel at the Madrid Conference, sponsored by the US and the Soviet Union. It negotiated an end to hostilities with Israel and signed a declaration to that effect on 25 July 1994. As a result, an Israeli-Jordanian peace treaty was concluded on 26 October 1994. King Hussein was later honored when his picture appeared on an Israeli postage stamp in recognition of the good relations he established with his neighbor. Since the signing of the peace treaty, the United States not only contributes hundreds of millions of dollars in an annual foreign aid stipend to Jordan, but also has allowed it to establish a free trade zone in which to manufacture goods that will enter the US without paying the usual import taxes as long as a percentage of the material used in them is purchased in Israel.
The last major strain in Jordan's relations with Israel occurred in September 1997 when Israeli agents allegedly[tpl]citation needed|date=January 2014[/tpl] entered Jordan using Canadian passports and poisoned Khaled Meshal, a senior Hamas leader. Israel provided an antidote to the poison and released dozens of political prisoners, including Sheikh Ahmed Yassin.
Upon the death of his father Hussein, Abdullah became king on 7 February 1999. Hussein had recently named him Crown Prince on 24 January, replacing Hussein's brother Hassan who had served many years in the position. Abdullah is the namesake of King Abdullah I, his great-grandfather and founder of modern-day Jordan.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.kingabdullah.jo/index.php/en_US/pages/view/id/148.html |title=Profile |publisher=King Abdullah II Official Website |accessdate=26 July 2012[/tpl]
Jordan's economy has improved greatly since Abdullah ascended to the throne in 1999. He has been credited with increasing foreign investment, improving public-private partnerships and providing the foundation for Aqaba's free-trade zone and Jordan's flourishing information and communication technology (ICT) sector. He also set up five other special economic zones: Irbid, Ajloun, Mafraq, Ma'an and the Dead Sea. As a result of these reforms, Jordan's economic growth has doubled to 6% annually under King Abdullah's rule compared to the latter half of the 1990s.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/ms/2006/112806.htm |title=Jordan—Concluding Statement for the 2006 Article IV Consultation and Fourth Post-Program Monitoring Discussions |publisher=International Monetary Fund |date=2006-11-28 |accessdate=2013-01-17[/tpl] Foreign direct investment from the West as well as the countries of the Persian Gulf has continued to increase.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.mop.gov.jo/pages.php?menu_id=241&local_type=0&local_id=0&local_details=0&local_details1=0 |title=Trade and Investment |publisher=Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation |date=2006-09-11 |accessdate=2013-01-17[/tpl] He also negotiated a free-trade agreement with the United States, which was the third free trade agreement for the U.S. and the first with an Arab country.[tpl]cite web |url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010928-12.html |title=Overview: U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement |publisher=White House Office of the Press Secretary |date= |accessdate=2013-01-17[/tpl]
During the suspension of Parliament between 2001 and 2003, the scope of King Abdullah II's power was demonstrated with the passing of 110 temporary laws.

==Geography==

Jordan lies on the continent of Asia between latitudes 29° and 34° N, and longitudes 35° and 40° E (a small area lies west of 35°). It consists of an arid plateau in the east, irrigated by oasis and seasonal water streams, with highland area in the west of arable land and Mediterranean evergreen forestry.
The Jordan Rift Valley of the Jordan River separates Jordan from Israel and the Palestinian Territories. The highest point in the country is Jabal Umm al Dami, at [tpl]convert|1854|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl] above sea level, its top is also covered with snow, while the lowest is the Dead Sea [tpl]convert|-420|m|ft|0|abbr=on[/tpl]. Jordan is part of a region considered to be "the cradle of civilization", the Levant region of the Fertile Crescent.
Major cities include the capital Amman and Salt in the west, Irbid, Jerash and Zarqa, in the northwest and Madaba, Karak and Aqaba in the southwest. Major towns in the eastern part of the country are the oasis town of Azraq and Ruwaished.

===Climate===

With hot, dry summers and cool winters during which practically all of the precipitation occurs, the country has a Mediterranean-style climate. In general, the farther inland from the Mediterranean a given part of the country lies, the greater are the seasonal contrasts in temperature and the less rainfall.

==Politics and government==

Although Jordan is a constitutional monarchy, the king holds wide executive and legislative powers. He serves as Head of State and Commander-in-Chief and appoints the executive branch consisting of the Prime Minister, the Cabinet of Jordan, and regional governors.[tpl]cite web |url=http://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2013/jordan |title=Jordan |publisher=Freedom House |work=Freedom in the World 2013 |accessdate=16 December 2013[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=DemocracyIndex12 |title=Democracy index 2012: Democracy at a standstill |publisher=Economist Intelligence Unit |date=14 March 2013 |accessdate=24 March 2013[/tpl] The current monarch is Abdullah II.
The Parliament of Jordan consists of two chambers: the House of Representatives (Majlis an-Nuwāb) and the Senate (Majlis al-'Aayan). The 150 members of the House are democratically elected from 12 constituencies, but 75 members of the Senate are all directly appointed by the King.[tpl]cite web |title=Q&A: Jordan election |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-21143037 |publisher=BBC News |date=22 January 2013[/tpl] Women's quota in the house of representatives is 15 seats. 108 seats are chosen from constituencies while the remaining 27 seats are chosen through proportional representation on nationwide party lists.
King Abdullah II succeeded his father Hussein following the latter's death in February 1999. Abdullah moved quickly to reaffirm Jordan's peace treaty with Israel and its relations with the United States. During the first year in power, he refocused the government's agenda on economic reform.
Jordan has multi-party politics. Political parties contest fewer than a fifth of the seats; the remainder are assigned to independent politicians.[tpl]cite news |title=As beleaguered as ever |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21564595 |publisher=The Economist |date=2012-10-13[/tpl] A new law enacted in July 2012 placed political parties under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Interior and forbade the establishment of parties based on religion.[tpl]cite web |title=Countries at the Crossroads: Jordan |url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/countries-crossroads/2012/jordan#_edn15 |publisher=Freedom House |accessdate=2013-03-05[/tpl]

===Law===

The Jordanian legal system is derived from Sharia and an Ottoman- Egyptian form of the Napoleonic Code. It has also been influenced by tribal traditions.[tpl]cite web |last=Husseini |first=Rana |title=Jordan |url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/inline_images/Jordan.pdf |work=Women’s Rights in the Middle East and North Africa: Progress Amid Resistance |publisher=Freedom House |page=3 |accessdate=2013-03-05[/tpl]
The highest court is the Court of Cassation, followed by the Courts of Appeal. The lower courts are divided into civil courts and sharia courts. Civil courts have jurisdiction over criminal and civil cases, while the sharia courts have jurisdiction over personal status for Muslims, including marriage, divorce, and inheritance; parallel tribunals handle such matters for non-Muslims. Shari’a courts also have jurisdiction over matters pertaining to the Islamic waqfs. In cases involving parties of different religions, regular courts have jurisdiction.[tpl]cite web |author=Business Optimization Consultants B.O.C. |url=http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/government4.html#The%20Judicial%20Branch |title=Jordan – Government – The Judicial Branch |publisher=Kinghussein.gov.jo |accessdate=15 June 2010[/tpl]
The Constitution of Jordan was adopted on January 11, 1952 and has been amended many times. Article 97 of Jordan's constitution guarantees the independence of the judicial branch, clearly stating that judges are 'subject to no authority but that of the law.' While the king must approve the appointment and dismissal of judges, in practice these are supervised by the Higher Judicial Council. Article 99 of the Constitution divides the courts into three categories: civil, religious and special. The civil courts deal with civil and criminal matters in accordance with the law, and they have jurisdiction over all persons in all matters, civil and criminal, including cases brought against the government. The civil courts include Magistrate Courts, Courts of First Instance, Courts of Appeal, High Administrative Courts and the Supreme Court.

===Foreign relations===

Jordan has followed a pro-Western foreign policy and maintained close relations with the United States and the United Kingdom. These relations were damaged by Jordan's neutrality and maintaining relations with Iraq during the first Gulf War. Following the Gulf War, Jordan largely restored its relations with Western countries through its participation in the Southwest Asia peace process and enforcement of UN sanctions against Iraq. Relations between Jordan and the Persian Gulf countries improved substantially after King Hussein's death in 1999.
Jordan is a key ally of the USA and UK and, together with Egypt, is one of only two Arab nations to have signed peace treaties with Israel.[tpl]cite news |title=Peace first, normalcy with Israel later: Egypt |newspaper=Al Arabiya News Channel |date=17 August 2009 |url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2009/08/17/82112.html |accessdate=10 November 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite news |title=Mideast peace drive gets two-prong boost |newspaper=Hurriyet Daily News and Economic Review |date=18 August 2009 |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=mideast-peace-drive-gets-two-prong-boost-2009-08-18 |accessdate=1 April 2010[/tpl]
In Israel in 2009, several Likud lawmakers proposed a bill that called for a Palestinian state on both sides of the Jordan River, presuming that Jordan should be the alternative homeland for the Palestinians.

Jordan is included in the European Union's European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer.

===Military===

The Jordanian military enjoys strong support and aid from the United States, the United Kingdom and France. This is due to its critical position between Israel, the West Bank, Syria, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia with very close proximity to Lebanon and Egypt. The development of the Special Operations Forces has been particularly significant, enhancing the capability of the forces to react rapidly to threats to state security, as well as training special forces from the region and beyond.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.globalresearch.ca/jordan-says-it-trained-2-500-afghan-special-forces/19149 |title=Jordan Says It Trained 2,500 Afghan Special Forces |publisher=Globalresearch.ca |date=13 May 2010 |accessdate=22 December 2010[/tpl][tpl]cite web |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ijjb8xn57wfIS3SSG1it64ydGeZg |title=AFP: Jordan trained 2,500 Afghan special forces: minister |publisher=Google |date=12 May 2010 |accessdate=22 December 2010[/tpl]

===Administrative divisions===

Jordan is divided into 12 provinces known as governorates, which, in turn, are subdivided into 54 departments or districts called nawahi.

==Economy==

Jordan is classified by the World Bank as a country of "upper-middle income". The economy has grown at an average rate of 4.3% per annum since 2005. Approximately 13% of the population lives on less than US$ 3 a day.
The GDP per capita rose by 351% in the 1970s, declined 30% in the 1980s, and rose 36% in the 1990s.[tpl]cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213054226/http://earthtrends.wri.org/text/economics-business/variable-638.html |title=GDP per capita |publisher=Wayback.archive.org |date=2010-02-13 |accessdate=2013-02-08[/tpl][tpl]Failed verification|date=February 2013[/tpl] Jordan has a free trade agreement with Turkey.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.zawya.com/story.cfm/sidZAWYA20101028044403 |title=Jordan and Turkey strengthening historical bonds |publisher=Zawya |date=2010-10-28 |accessdate=2013-02-08[/tpl] Jordan also enjoys advanced status with the EU.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.jordantimes.com/?news=31315 |title=Jordan obtains 'advanced status' with EU |publisher=Jordan Times |accessdate=2013-02-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220083621/http://www.jordantimes.com/?news=31315 |archivedate=2011-02-20[/tpl]
The Jordanian economy is based by insufficient supplies of water, oil and other natural resources. Other challenges include high budget deficit, high outstanding public debt, high levels of poverty and unemployment. Unemployment in 2012 is nominally around 13%, but is thought by many analysts to be as high as a quarter of the working-age population. Youth unemployment is nearly 30%. Jordan has few natural resources and a small industrial base. Corruption is particularly pronounced and the use of wasta widespread. Jordan also suffers from a brain drain of its most talented workers. Remittances from Jordanian expatriates are a major source of foreign exchange.
Due to slow domestic growth, high energy and food subsidies and a bloated public-sector workforce, Jordan usually runs annual budget deficits. These are partially offset by international aid.
Jordan’s economy is relatively well diversified. Trade and finance combined account for nearly one-third of GDP; transportation and communication, public utilities, and construction account for one-fifth, and mining and manufacturing constitute nearly that proportion. Despite plans to increase the private sector, the state remains the dominant force in Jordan’s economy.[tpl]cite web |title=Jordan : Demographic trends |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/306128/Jordan/23346/Demographic-trends#toc23347 |publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |accessdate=2013-03-05[/tpl] The government employs between one-third and two-thirds of all workers.

The Great Recession and the turmoil caused by the Arab Spring have depressed Jordan's GDP growth, impacting export-oriented sectors, construction, and tourism. Tourist arrivals have dropped sharply since 2011, hitting an important source of revenue and employment.[tpl]cite web |title=Harsh blow to Jordanian economy |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7c904b80-a1a8-11e0-b9f9-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2Ii3L4rS7 |publisher=FT.com |date=June 28, 2011[/tpl]
In an attempt to quell popular discontent, the government promised in 2011 to keep energy and food prices artificially low while raising wages and pensions in the public sector. Jordan's finances have also been strained by a series of natural gas pipeline attacks in Egypt, causing it to substitute more expensive heavy-fuel oils to generate electricity. $500 million was required to cover the resulting fuel shortage.
In August 2012, the International Monetary Fund agreed to give Jordan a three-year $2-billion loan. As part of the deal, Jordan was expected to cut spending. In November 2012, the government cut subsidies on fuel, increasing its price. As a result, large scale protests broke out across the country and the increase was removed.[tpl]cite web |last=Sharp |first=Jeremy M. |title=Jordan: Background and US Relations |url=http://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/199396.pdf |publisher=Congressional Research Service |pages=7–8 |date=2012-10-03[/tpl]

German is an increasingly popular language among the elite and the educated; it's been most likely introduced at a larger scale after the début of the Deutsche Universität, or as officially named, the German-Jordanian University. A historic society of German Protestants of Amman continue to use the German language in their events and daily lives.[tpl]cite web |url=http://www.amman.diplo.de/contentblob/2563044/Daten/630800/GPCCA_Downloaddatei.pdf |title=German Protestant Community Center Amman |publisher=Deutsche Botschaft Amman - Jordanien |date= |accessdate=2013-06-26[/tpl]

 GUESS TEXT:

CATEGORIES: Districts of Karnataka, Raichur district

Raichur District is an administrative district in the Indian state of Karnataka. It is located in the northeast part of the state and is bounded by Yadgir district in the north, Bijapur and Bagalkot district in the northwest, Koppal district in the west, Bellary district in the south, Mahabubnagar and Kurnool districts of Andhra Pradesh in the east.

==Geography==

The district is bounded by the Krishna River on the north and the Tungabhadra River on the south. The wedge of land between the rivers is known as the Raichur Doab, after the city of Raichur. Bijapur and Gulbarga districts lie to the north across the Krishna River. Bagalkot and Koppal districts lie to the west. Across the Tungabhadra lies Bellary District of Karnataka to the southwest and Mahabubnagar of Andhra Pradesh to the southeast. Kurnool District of Andhra Pradesh state lies to the east, and includes the lower portion of the Raichur-584 102.

==History==

The recorded history of the district is traced to as far back as the third century B.C. The fact that three minor rock edicts of Ashoka are found in this district one at Maski in the Lingasugur taluk and the other two near Koppal, prove that this area was included in the dominions of the great Mauryan king Ashoka (273 - 236 B.C.). At that time, this region was under the governance of the Viceroy or Mahamatra of Ashoka. Early in the Christian era, the district appears to have been a part of the kingdom of the Satavahanas. The Vakatakas, who reigned during the 3rd and 4th centuries A.D., seem to have held sway over Raichur for sometime, after which it appears to have been included in the Kadamba dominions. The next dynasty of importance, which ruled over this region, was that of the Chalukyas of Badami. According to an inscription from Aihole, Pulikeshi-II having defeated the Pallavas, occupied this area and made it a province in his empire under the governance of his son Adityavarma. Later the whole of the present Raichur district was included in the dominions of the Rashtrakutas, who rose to power in the eighth century, as could be gathered from the inscriptions of that period found in this district. According to an inscription from Manvi taluk, one Jagattunga, a subordinate ruler under the Rashtrakuta king Krishna-II, was ruling the province of Adedore Eradusavirapranta, i.e., the area constituting the present Raichur district. Nripatunga, a Rashtrakuta king, has described Koppal in his Kannada work, Kavirajamarga, as the great Kopananagara.
Numerous inscriptions of the Western Chalukyas, found in the various parts of the district, testify to the fact that this region was under their sway for a considerable length of time between the 10th and 12th centuries A.D. It is learnt from an inscription found at Naoli in Lingsugur taluk that during the reign of Chalukya Vikramaditya-V, the Adedore-pranta, i.e., the Raichur region, was being ruled by his younger brother Jagadekamalla-I. Another inscription from Maski describes the place as a capital and makes a reference to the reign of Jayasimha. There were, however, frequent wars between the Chola kings of the south and the Chalukyan kings of Kalyani (aka Western Chalukyas) for supremacy over the Raichur region and the territory had passed into the hands of the Cholas for a brief period. The Haihayas and Sindas also seem to have ruled some parts of this region for sometime. Later, after the fall of the Chalukyas, Raichur passed into the hands of the Kalachuri and later Sevna Yadava kings. Then came the Kakatiyas in the 13th century. From an inscription on the fort-wall of Raichur, referred to earlier, it is learn that the original fort was built by one Gore Gangayya Reddy, a general of the Kakatiya queen Rudramma Devi of Warangal, in 1294 A.D., at the instance of the latter.http://www.raichur.nic.in/History.htm Raichur was sacked by Malik Kafur, was commander of Sultanate of Delhi in 1312.
Raichur district was passed to Vijayanagara Empire in 1323 after demise of Kakatiyas due to invasions of Sultanate of Delhi. It was captured by Bahmani Sultanate in 1363. It was passed to Bijapur Sultanate in 1489 after fragmentation of Bahmanids. Vicayanagara recaptured it after Battle of Raichur in 1520 but Bijapur recaptured it in 1565 after Vijayanagara's defeat at hands of Deccan Sultanates during Battle of Talikota. Aurangzeb, emperor of Mughal Empire captured the district in 1686. Finally 1724 Raichur became part of Nizam of Hyderabad between 1724 and 1948 except British Empire rule between 1853 and 1860 as part of Madras Presidency. During Nizam rule it was part of Gulbarga Division.
After the Operation Polo, Nizam was forcibly integrated to Indian Union in 17 September 1948. Between 1948 and 1956, it was part of Hyderabad State. During division the state based linguistic basis, it was become part of Mysore State, later was renamed State of Karnataka.
