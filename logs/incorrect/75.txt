==History==

Five businessmen founded 3M in Two Harbors, Minnesota, in 1902."3M." Company Profiles for Students. Gale. 1999. Retrieved October 4, 2012,fromHighBeam Research: http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3427200011.html Originally a mining venture,  the goal was to mine corundum, but this failed because the mine's mineral holdings were anorthosite, which had no commercial value. Co-founder John Dwan solicited funds in exchange for stock and Edgar Ober and Lucius Ordway took over the company in 1905. The company moved to Duluth and began research and producing sandpaper products. William L. McKnight, later a key executive, joined the company in 1907, and A. G. Bush joined in 1909. 3M finally became financially stable in 1916 and was able to pay dividends.
The company moved to St. Paul, where it remained for 52 years before outgrowing the campus and moving to its current headquarters at 3M Centre in Maplewood, Minnesota. The new Maplewood campus is [tpl]Convert|475|acre|km2[/tpl] and has over 50 buildings, including an Innovation Center that displays products 3M has taken to market.
The company began by mining stone from quarries for use in grinding wheels. Struggling with quality and marketing of its products, management supported its workers to innovate and develop new products, which became its core business.[tpl]cite book|title=A Century of Innovation|publisher=3M Company|year=2002[/tpl] Twelve years after its inception, 3M developed its first exclusive product: Three-M-ite cloth. Other innovations in this era included masking tape, waterproof sandpaper, and Scotch brand tapes. By 1929, 3M had made its first moves toward international expansion by forming Durex to conduct business in Europe. The same year, the company’s stock was first traded over the counter and in 1946 listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The company is currently a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and of the S&P 500.

===Founding===

The founders original plan was to sell the mineral corundum to manufacturers in the East for making grinding wheels. After selling one load, on June 13, 1902, the five went to the Two Harbors office of company secretary John Dwan, which was on the shore of Lake Superior and is now part of the 3M National Museum, and signed papers making Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing a corporation. In reality, however, Dwan and his associates were not selling what they thought; they were really selling the worthless mineral anorthosite.[tpl]cite web|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200206/03_haega_3Mhistory |title=MPR: 3M at 100 – on the right path for growth? |publisher=News.minnesota.publicradio.org |accessdate=March 29, 2012[/tpl]
Failing to make sandpaper with the anorthosite, the founders decided to import minerals like Spanish garnet, after which sale of sandpapers grew. In 1914, customers complained that the garnet was falling off the paper. The founders discovered that the stones had traveled across the Atlantic Ocean packed near olive oil, and the oil had penetrated the stones. Unable to take the loss of selling expensive inventory, they roasted the stones over fire to remove the olive oil; this was the first instance of research and development at 3M.

===Expansion===

The company's late innovations include waterproof sandpaper (1921) and masking tape (1925), as well as cellophane "Scotch Tape" and sound-deadening materials for cars.
During the 1950s, the company expanded worldwide with operations in Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, Australia, and the United Kingdom in large part by Clarence Sampair. In 1951, international sales were approximately $20 million. 3M’s achievements were recognized by the American Institute of Management naming the company “one of the five best-managed companies in the United States" and included it among the top 12 growth stocks (3M).[tpl]cite web|title=1950 Achievements|url=http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/our/company/information/history/timeline/1950-achievements solutions.3m.com|publisher=3M.com|accessdate=July 28, 2010[/tpl]
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, 3M published a line of board games, largely under the "3M bookshelf game series" brand. These games were marketed to adults and sold through department stores, with easily learned simple rules but complex game play and depth and with uniformly high-quality components. As such, they are the ancestors of the German "Eurogames". The games covered a variety of topics, from business and sports simulations to word and abstract strategy games. They were a major publisher at the time for influential U.S. designers Sid Sackson and Alex Randolph. In the mid-1970s, the game line was taken over by Avalon Hill.
3M's Mincom division introduced several models of magnetic tape recorders for instrumentation use and for studio sound recording. An example of the latter is the model M79 recorder, which still has a following today. 3M Mincom was also involved in designing and manufacturing video production equipment for the television and video post-production industries in the 1970s and 1980s, with such items as character generators and several different models of video switchers, from models of audio and video routers to video mixers for studio production work.
3M Mincom was involved in some of the first digital audio recordings of the late 1970s to see commercial release when a prototype machine was brought to the Sound 80 studios in Minneapolis. After drawing on the experience of that prototype recorder, 3M later introduced in 1979 a commercially available digital audio recording system called the "3M Digital Audio Mastering System",[tpl]cite web|url=http://mixonline.com/TECnology-Hall-of-Fame/1978-EM-Mastering/ |title=1978 3M Digital Audio Mastering System-Mix Inducts 3M Mastering System Into 2007 TECnology Hall of Fame |publisher=Mixonline.com |date=September 1, 2007 |accessdate=March 29, 2012[/tpl] which consisted of a 32-track digital audio tape recorder and a companion 4-track digital recorder for final mastering. 3M later designed and manufactured several other commercially available models of digital audio recorders used throughout the early to mid-1980s.
In 1980, the company introduced Post-it notes. In 1996, the company's data storage and imaging divisions were spun off as the Imation Corporation. Imation has since sold its imaging and photographic film businesses to concentrate on storage.
Today, 3M is one of the 30 companies included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (added on August 9, 1976), and is 97 on the 2011 Fortune 500 list.[tpl]cite news|title=Fortune 500 2011: Fortune 1,000 Companies 1–100|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2011/full_list/|work=Fortune Magazine|accessdate=January 9, 2012[/tpl] The company has 132 plants and over 67,000 employees worldwide, with sales offices in over 200 countries.

In addition, on February 19, 2006, 3M announced that it would become the title sponsor of the 3M Performance 400 at Michigan International Speedway for at least the next three years.
On April 4, 2006, 3M announced its intention to sell its pharmaceutical non-core business. The pharmaceuticals businesses were sold off in three deals, in Europe, the Americas, and the remainder of the world. Another division of the Health Care business, Drug Delivery Systems, remains with 3M. The Drug Delivery System division continues to contract manufacture inhalants and transdermal drug-delivery systems, and has now taken on manufacture of the products whose licenses were sold during the divestiture of the pharmaceuticals business.

Lake Abitibi ([tpl]lang-fr|Lac Abitibi[/tpl]) is a lake in northeastern Ontario and western Quebec, Canada.  The lake, which lies within the vast Clay Belt, is separated in two distinct portions by a short narrows, making it actually 2 lakes. Its total area is 931 km², and net area 903 km².Atlas of Canada The lake is shallow and studded with islands.  Its shores and vicinity are covered with small timber.
Its outlet is the Abitibi River, a tributary the Moose River, which empties into James Bay.  The lake takes its name from the river.  "Abitibi" comes from the Algonquin words abitah, meaning middle and nipi meaning water,[tpl]cite encyclopedia |editor-first=Dale H. |editor-last=Hoiberg|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica |title=Abitibi River|edition = 15th |year=2010|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica Inc. |volume=I: A-ak Bayes |location=Chicago, IL |isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=33[/tpl] possibly a reference to its geographic location between the Harricana (from the Algonquin word Nanikana, meaning "the main way")Environnement Québec, North Harricana River Aquatic Reserve|http://www.mddep.gouv.qc.ca/biodiversite/aquatique/harricana-nord/note-en.pdf Online version to the east and the Kapuskasing–Mattagami river system to the west.

It was formerly used by the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) as part of a canoe route to the fur lands of the north.  A HBC trading post was located on the east shore of the lake in Ontario.Lake Abitibi Post Canadian Heritage Gallery  The construction of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (now Canadian National Railway) through this district made it of some importance at the start of the 20th century.
