I am going to give you a JSON string that looks like this:
{
    "question": "<question>"
    "quesses": [
        "<quess1>",
        "<guess2>",
        .
        .
        .
    ]
}
Where <question> is a fact about an unknown object, and guesses is a list of quesses for what the object could be, ranked.

I want you to rerank the list of guesses and return a better ranking of guesses for the question, also in JSON format, like this:
{
    "reranked_guesses": [
        "<quess1>",
        "<guess2>",
        .
        .
        .
    ]
}

The rest of the input after this sentence is the JSON string.
